Who is Tiffany Chin dating now & how much money does Tiffany Chin have?</p><h2>Tiffany Chin Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Tiffany Chin</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Figure Skater</strong> who was born on <strong>October 3, 1967</strong> in Oakland, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Chin was born the 3rd of October 1967 at Oakland, California.&nbsp;She was raised within San Diego, California.&nbsp;She earned an BA in English from the University of California, Los Angeles.&nbsp;Kyle, her son Kyle was born in February 2004.</p><p>In 1984, at the U.S. Championships, she was fourth in the mandatory figures but was able to win both the long and short programs.&nbsp;In the second place finish behind Rosalynn Sumners She received the silver medal and included in the U.S. team to the 1984 Winter Olympic in Sarajevo.&nbsp;In the Olympics, Chin placed 12th in the compulsory figures , but was able to climb to fourth overall, after placing first in short skating and second free skating.&nbsp;Chin missed competing in the World Championships due to injury.</p><p>At the 1985 World Championships, Chin was in a strong position to contend for the title after placing second in both the compulsory figures and the short program. However, in her free skate, she popped her triple Salchow into a single and fell on her final double axel, finishing third in the free program and third overall behind Katarina Witt and Kira Ivanova. As had been the case all season, the toe loop was the only triple she executed successfully. In the summer of 1985, her mother, Marjorie, pulled her off the ice for three months due to her muscle imbalance.</p><p>In the fall of 1986, Chin returned to Nicks as her coach. She switched again to Carroll prior to the 1987 U.S. Championships. At that event she was in third place after the compulsory figures and short program, but was unable to complete a triple jump or clean double axel in her long program and dropped to fourth overall, failing to qualify for the World Championships for the first time since her U.S. senior national debut in 1982. Needing only a 4th-place finish in the long program after Kadvavy’s poor short program, Chin’s long program was narrowly beaten by a young Tonya Harding, dropping Chin behind Kadavy and off the world team.</p><p align=justify>Chin began her next Olympic quadrennium with a silver medal in the 1984 Skate Canada International, in which she placed second behind Japanese’s Midori Ito.&nbsp;Chin suffered a decrease in technical consistency and consistency that she had experienced in her previous seasons and relied almost entirely on the triple toe , and didn’t even try a triple flip, or perform a successful triple salchow during the entire season.&nbsp;Despite a decline in the short program , and an unorthodox long program, she was first in every phase of the event at the 1985 U.S. Championships.&nbsp;The U.S. national title was the first singles’ championship for Asian-Americans or any other non-European origin.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tiffany Chin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tiffany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Figure Skater</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oakland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marjorie Chin, Edward Chin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tiffany Chin ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Tiffany Chin</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Audrey Tiffany Chin (born October 3 1967) is an American figure skating coach and former competitor.&nbsp;She was two-time World bronze medallist (1985-1986) and twice Skate America champion (1983, 1986) as well as in 1985, she was the U.S. national champion.</p><p align=justify>Chin took home Chin won the 1981 World Junior Championships, which was held in December the year 1980, at London, Ontario, Canada.</p><p align=justify>After a growth spurt and a recurring injury (a muscle imbalance affecting her legs, arms, and hips) that caused her to lose many of her triple jumps, Chin left Nicks in 1985 and went on to train with Don Laws.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Figure Skater</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sensing only slim chances of making the Olympic team against the trifecta of Thomas, Kadavy, and Trenary, Chin retired from Olympic-eligible skating in the fall of 1987.</p><p>Chin remained involved in figure skating by becoming a coach. Her former students include Beatrisa Liang and Hounsh Munshi. Liang left Chin in 2004 when Chin took some time off from coaching because she was expecting a child. Chin became a technical specialist in 2006, receiving national status a year later.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tiffany Chin height</b> <strong>5 ft 3 in</strong> Tiffany <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After undergoing a course of traditional medicine and chiropractic treatments, Chin began to relearn her skating technique under a new coach, Don Laws. She entered the 1986 U.S. Championships as an underdog and finished third overall behind Debi Thomas and Caryn Kadavy. Chin qualified for the World Championships in Geneva, where she placed fourth in the compulsories and tied for second in the short program to enter the long program in third place. With Witt defeating Thomas in the long program, Chin as the last skater was in position to win the gold by winning the free skate, or to aid Witt in passing Thomas for the gold should she have split them in the long program. A fourth-place finish in the long program (behind Witt, Thomas, and Elizabeth Manley) with one clean triple jump, one other triple with a slight touch down, several double axels, and good presentation scores, was enough to give her the bronze medal overall behind Thomas and Witt.</p><p align=justify>In 2010, Chin became the coach of Australia’s Kailani Craine, who would qualify a spot at the 2018 Winter Olympics.</p><h2>Who is Tiffany Chin Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tiffany Chin</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
