According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mo'ne Davis</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was a natural athlete from the age of 7, when she was already throwing perfect curves with a football to her older brother and cousins.</p><p align=justify>She was the first Little League player of either gender to be featured on the Sports Illustrated cover.&nbsp;Time magazine named her one of the 25 Most Influential Teens in 2014, while SI Kids selected her as the Sports Kid Of The Year for 2014.</p><p align=justify>In 2014, writing for CNN, Kelly Wallace suggested that Davis’ accomplishments will affect both girls and boys, women and men. In Wallace’s view, she will inspire girls who want to play baseball in the future. To support this view, Wallace cited the case of Stephanie Tuck, who, as a girl, played on a Little League team. Tuck, recounting the experience of Little league play, said “I was heckled by the dads: ‘Get that girl off the field.’ I used to literally pray the ball would not come to me in right field, as the pressure was so intense.” Wallace also wrote that Davis’ play will remove the “specialness” of girls playing at the level of boys. In the future, fans will look at how good a player is, and gender will not be important. For men and boys, Wallace argued that Davis’ performance will reduce gender biases about the roles of boys and girls. For example, “Throwing like a girl”, according to Wallace, now has a completely different and positive meaning. Melissa Isaacson, writing for ABC News, expressed similar views. Wallace also speculated that the more attention female athletes such as Davis receive from girls, boys, men, and women, the more popular women’s sports will become. Finally, Wallace suggested that the tremendous interest that Davis has piqued in the Little League World Series might lead to increased participation of both boys and girls in baseball, which has suffered from major league “performance-enhancing drug scandals”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2014, Paul Graziano, who had been the Little League World Series press box announcer for the last 34 years, stated that he had never seen the level of excitement as early in the tournament and that this was partly due to the presence of Davis. The crowds cheered every time Davis pitches or was at bat, and she received standing ovations as she was pitching her shut-out win on August 15, 2014.</p><p>She appeared on the August 25, 2014 Sports Illustrated front cover, which made her the first Little League baseball player to appear on the front cover of a top US sports magazine as a Little League player.
