Who is Orson Scott Card dating now & how much money does Orson Scott Card have?</p><h2>Orson Scott Card Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Orson Scott Card</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Novelist</strong> who was born on <strong>August 24, 1951</strong> in Richland, Washington, <strong>United States</strong>. Science fiction writer who wrote The Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novels, Ender’s Game and Speaker for the Dead.&nbsp;Other notable works comprise Seventh Son, Red Prophet as well as Alvin Journeyman.</p><p>The character of Ender Wiggin was played as Ender Wiggin by&nbsp;Asa Butterfield&nbsp;in the 2013 Version of Ender’s Game.</p><p>Orson Scott Card (born August 24, 1951) is an American novelist, critic, public speaker, essayist, and columnist. He writes in several genres but is known best for his science fiction works. His novel Ender’s Game (1985) and its sequel Speaker for the Dead (1986) won both Hugo and Nebula Awards, making Card the first author to win the two top American prizes in science fiction literature in consecutive years. A feature film adaptation of Ender’s Game, which Card co-produced, was released in 2013. Card also wrote the Locus Fantasy Award-winning series The Tales of Alvin Maker (1987–2003).</p><p>In 1964, Card and his family moved to Mesa, Arizona, where he participated in mock debates in junior high school. In 1967, the family moved to Orem, Utah, where his father worked at Brigham Young University (BYU). Card attended BYU’s laboratory school, where he took both high school and early college-level classes. At first he intended to major in anthropology but after becoming increasingly more interested in theater, he began script-writing, writing ten original plays and rewriting other students’ plays. Most of his plays were based on Mormon history and scriptures; one was science fiction. Card said script-writing developed his writing skills because he could tell when an audience was interested in his scripts by their body language. During his studies as a theater major, he began doctoring scripts, adapting fiction for reader’s theater production, and writing one-act and full-length plays, several of which were produced by faculty directors at BYU. Charles W. Whitman, Card’s play-writing professor, encouraged his students to write plays with LDS themes. Card studied poetry with Clinton F. Larson at BYU. He also wrote short stories, which were later published together in The Worthing Saga.</p><p align=justify>A fervent Mormon and a Mormon, he was married to Kristine Card.&nbsp;All the children had names based on famous writers. Unfortunately, one child passed away in the infant stage and another suffered from cerebral palsy when he was seventeen.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Orson Scott Card</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Orson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Card</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kristine Allen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Emily Janice Card, Charles Benjamin Card, Erin Louisa Card, Zina Margaret Card, Michael Geoffrey Card</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Orson Scott Card ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Card’s family has Mormon pioneer heritage; Brigham Young, one of his great-great-grandfathers, was the second president of the LDS Church and led the Mormon pioneers west to Salt Lake City, where they settled. Charles Ora Card, who founded the first Mormon settlement in Canada, was Card’s great-grandfather from his paternal line who married Brigham Young’s daughter Zina P. Young Card. Their daughter Zina Young Card Brown married Hugh B. Brown, who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency of the LDS Church.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1976 Card became an assistant editor at the LDS Church’s magazine Ensign and moved to Salt Lake City. While working at Ensign, Card published his first piece of fiction, a short story called Gert Fram, which appeared in the July 1977 issue of Ensign under the pseudonym Byron Walley. Between 1978 and 1988, Card wrote over 300 half-hour audioplays on LDS Church history, the New Testament, and other subjects for Living Scriptures in Ogden, Utah.</p><p>Card’s 1977 novella Ender’s Game is about a young boy who undergoes military training for space war. Ender believes he is controlling simulated spaceships but is actually controlling real spaceships. Card expanded the story into a novel with the same title (1985) to tell the backstory of the adult Ender in Speaker for the Dead. In contrast to the fast-paced Ender’s Game, Speaker for the Dead is about honesty and maturity. Ender’s Game and Speaker for the Dead were both awarded the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award, making Card the only author (as of 2019) to win both of science fiction’s top prizes in consecutive years. According to Card, some members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) resented his receiving of the Nebula award while editing the Nebula Awards Report. Subsequently, Card left the SFWA.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Orson Scott Card height</b> Not available right now.

Influences from Portuguese and Brazilian Catholicism are evident in his Shadow novels and his Speaker novels. While on his mission, he wrote a play called Stone Tables. He returned from his mission in 1973 and graduated from BYU in 1975, receiving a bachelor’s degree with distinction in theater. After graduation, he started the Utah Valley Repertory Theatre Company, which for two summers produced plays at “the Castle”, a Depression-era outdoor amphitheater. After going into debt with the community theatre’s expenses,Card took part-time employment as a proofreader at BYU Press, moving on to full-time employment as a copy editor. In 1981, Card completed his master’s degree in English at the University of Utah where he studied with François Camoin, Norman Council, and David Kranes. He began a doctoral program at the University of Notre Dame but dropped out to pursue his more lucrative writing projects. At the University of Notre Dame, he was inspired by Professor Ed Vasta’s love for his students and teaching.</p><p align=justify>Card started writing science fiction short stories because he felt he could sell short stories in that genre more easily than others. His first short story The Tinker was initially rejected by Analog Science Fiction and Fact. Ben Bova, the editor of Analog, rejected a rewrite of the story but asked Card to submit a science fiction piece. In response, Card wrote the short story Ender’s Game, which Ben Bova published in the August 1977 issue of Analog. Card left The Ensign in 1977 and began his career as a freelance writer in 1978. Ben Bova continued to work with Card to publish his stories and his wife Barbara Bova became Card’s literary agent, a development that drew criticism of a possible conflict of interest. Nine of Card’s science fiction stories, including Malpractice, Kingsmeat, and Happy Head, were published in 1978.</p><h2>Who is Orson Scott Card Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Orson Scott Card</strong> married to <strong>Kristine Allen</strong>.

He received advances for the manuscripts of Hot Sleep and A Planet Called Treason, which were published in 1979. Card later called his first two novels “amateurish” and rewrote both of them later. A publisher offered to buy a novelization of Mikal’s Songbird, which Card accepted; the finished novel is titled Songmaster (1980). Card edited fantasy anthologies Dragons of Light (1980) and Dragons of Darkness (1981), and collected his own short stories in Unaccompanied Sonata and Other Stories (1981). In the early 1980s, Card focused on writing longer works, only publishing ten short stories between 1980 and 1985. He published a few non-fiction works that were aimed at an LDS audience; these include a satirical dictionary called Saintspeak, which resulted in him being temporarily banned from publishing in church magazines. Card wrote the fantasy-epic Hart’s Hope (1983) and a historical novel, A Woman of Destiny (1984), which was later republished as Saints and won the 1985 award from the Association for Mormon Letters for best novel. He rewrote the narrative of Hot Sleep and published it as The Worthing Chronicle (1983), which replaced Hot Sleep and the short-story collection set in the same universe, Capitol (1979). The recession of the early 1980s made it difficult to get contracts for new books so Card returned to full-time employment as the book editor of Compute! magazine that was based in Greensboro, North Carolina, for nine months in 1983. In October of that year, Tom Doherty offered a contract for Card’s proposed Alvin Maker series, which allowed him to return to creative writing full-time.</p><h2>Top Facts about Orson Scott Card</h2><li>Orson Scott Card is an American science fiction novelist.</li><li>He was born on August 24, 1951 in Richland, Washington.</li><li>His most famous work is the novel “Ender’s Game”.</li><li>Card has won numerous awards for his writing.</li><li>He is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</li><li>Card has written over 60 books in various genres.</li><li>He has also worked as a professor and editor.</li><li>In addition to writing, he is known for his political views.</li><li>Card has been criticized for his controversial opinions on LGBT issues.</li><li>Despite controversy, he remains a popular and influential author in the science fiction genre.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Orson Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Novelist</strong>.
