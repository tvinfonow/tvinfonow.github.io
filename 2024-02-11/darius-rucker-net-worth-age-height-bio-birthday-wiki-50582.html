The lead singer of the pop band Hootie & the Blowfish, the group is known for its songs such as “Only Wanna Be With You” and “Hold My Hand.”&nbsp;As a solo artist the singer is most famous for the hit song “Wagon Wheel” off his album, True Believers.</p><p>He is a good friend of&nbsp;He is good friends with <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a>..</p><p>Darius Rucker has been the lead singer of Hootie & the Blowfish since its formation in 1986. He met fellow band members Mark Bryan, Jim “Soni” Sonefeld, and Dean Felber while attending the University of South Carolina. Bryan first heard Rucker singing in the shower, and the two became a duo, playing R.E.M. covers at a local venue. They later recruited Felber and finally Sonefeld joined in 1989. As a member of Hootie & the Blowfish, Rucker has recorded six studio albums: Cracked Rear View – 1994, Fairweather Johnson – 1996, Musical Chairs – 1998, Scattered, Smothered & Covered – 2000, Hootie & the Blowfish and Looking for Lucky – 2005, also charting within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 six times. All six albums feature songs that Rucker, Bryan and Felber wrote. As the frontman, Rucker began to be called simply “Hootie” by fans, though the band title combines the nicknames of his college friends. Before his rise to fame, he lived in the basement of the Sigma Phi Epsilon house at the University of South Carolina, attempting to launch his career through the college bar scene.</p><p>Rucker’s mother died in November 1992 of a heart attack. His grief inspired two Hootie & the Blowfish songs: “I’m Goin’ Home” and “Not Even the Trees.” On April 21, 1995, his girlfriend (Elizabeth Ann Phillips) gave birth to Rucker’s first child, Carolyn Pearl Phillips. His second daughter, Daniella Rose, was born to his wife, Beth, on May 16, 2001. They had a son, Jack, in 2005. The Hootie song “Where Were You” is about Rucker’s strained relationship with his father, and was released only in Europe, where Rucker thought that his father would be unlikely to hear it. His country single “Alright” was inspired by his marriage.</p><p align=justify>He was engaged to Beth Leonard on December 9 1999.&nbsp;Leonard and Leonard share three daughters, named Daniella, Caroline and Jack.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Darius Rucker</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Darius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rucker</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charleston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Beth Leonard</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Darius Rucker ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
