Who is Caitlin Doughty dating now & how much money does Caitlin Doughty have?</p><h2>Caitlin Doughty Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Caitlin Doughty</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>YouTube Star</strong> who was born on <strong>August 19, 1984</strong> in Hawaii, Hawaii, <strong>United States</strong>. Most famous for her ‘Ask a Mortician’ web series, Doughty is also known for her activism on behalf of funeral industry reform and the death acceptance movement. In 2014, she published a bestselling book titled Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Other Lessons from the Crematory.</p><p>She and country singer <a href=#>John Conlee</a> both became licensed morticians.</p><p>Caitlin Marie Doughty (born August 19, 1984) is an American mortician, author, blogger, and YouTube personality known for advocating death acceptance and the reform of Western funeral industry practices. She is the owner of Clarity Funerals and Cremation of Los Angeles, creator of the Web series “Ask a Mortician”, founder of The Order of the Good Death, and author of three bestselling books, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes & Other Lessons from the Crematory in 2014, and From Here to Eternity; Traveling the World to Find the Good Death in 2017, and Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?: Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death in 2019, both published by W.W. Norton and Company.</p><p>After graduation and moving to San Francisco in 2006, at age 22, she sought hands-on exposure to modern death practices in funeral homes, and after seeking employment for six months, was hired in the crematory of Pacific Interment (called Westwind Cremation & Burial in her book) despite her lack of any experience in the funeral industry. Pacific Interment could be called “the anti-Forest Lawn”, referring to what Doughty sees as the theme-park-like, kitschy corporate funeral behemoth that much of modern American funeral practice is modeled on. She picked up corpses from homes and hospitals in a van, prepared them for viewings, cremated them, and delivered the cremains to the families. Dealing with bureaucracy, such as acquiring death certificates or obtaining the release of a body from the coroner, occupied much of her work. Her boss and coworkers at Pacific Interment often tested her with very hands-on assignments, as on her first day at work she had to shave a corpse, and Doughty unflappably accepted any task, a willing jack-of-all-trades, eager to prove her mettle.</p><p align=justify>She was born and raised in Oahu, Hawaii, and she later lived in Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Caitlin Doughty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Caitlin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doughty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>YouTube Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hawaii</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hawaii</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Caitlin Doughty ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Caitlin Doughty's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Caitlin Doughty's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Doughty is the founder of “The Order of the Good Death” an inclusive community of funeral industry professionals, academics, as well as artists who advocate for and make possible, a more death informed society. “The Order of the Good Death” is presented to the public as a website that shares articles and information by prominent figures in the death industry that make individuals more informed about the inevitable conclusion of one’s life. In previous years the public had an engagement with the cemetery as a community place, which people do not have anymore. The Order of the Good Death is Doughty’s way of creating a community while teaching individuals to accept death. Doughty’s work has a strong focus on ways of “making death a part of one’s life”. “If Doughty and the Order’s death-care revolution is successful, Americans will be more comfortable contemplating mortality and dying— thus preparing for it, seriously considering alternatives such as green burial, composting, and using crematoria that have carbon-offset policies”.</p><h2>Caitlin Doughty Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Caitlin Doughty is one of the <strong>richest YouTube Star</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Caitlin Doughty</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>After graduating from the University of Chicago with a bachelor’s degree in Medieval History and a concentration in Death and Culture, she began her career as a mortician at San Francisco’s Westwind Cremation and Burial.</p><p align=justify>Her keen interest in societal treatment of death is likely rooted in the fact that, as a young girl, she witnessed the sudden demise of a fellow child in an accident. She turned her early morbid fascination into a highly successful career; by 2015, she had more than 39,000 YouTube subscribers and had created an organization called The Order of the Good Death.</p><p align=justify>Doughty’s main inspiration for her advocacy work was the frequent absence of the decedents’ families in the process, which she attributed to the Western death anxiety and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, and a return to such practices as memento mori, reminders of one’s own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen as a threat to the traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford’s book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty’s inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry’s, and the public’s, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford’s reforms but in a direction that embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>YouTube Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since writing the book, Doughty began working to launch Undertaking LA, a funeral service alternative to the mainstream funeral options. It started as a seminar series meant to educate the public on their death options under California law. As of 2014, the service consisted of “two licensed morticians telling the public, ‘you don’t need us!'”, instead advocating DIY funerals.</p><p>In September 2014, Doughty’s first book, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes & Other Lessons from the Crematory was published by W. W. Norton & Company. It is a memoir of her experiences that serves as a manifesto of her goals. The book is named for the 20th-century pop song “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes”, in reference to both the literal smoke of cremation and the associated emotions. W. W. Norton’s Tom Mayer outbid seven other publishers for the worldwide rights to Smoke Gets in Your Eyes in 2012. The book debuted at #14 on The New York Times and at #10 on the Los Angeles Times bestseller lists of hardcover nonfiction for the week ending October 5, 2014.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Caitlin Doughty height</b> <strong>6 feet 1 inches</strong> Caitlin <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 1 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Doughty’s YouTube series “Ask a Mortician”, began in 2011, humorously explores morbid and sometimes taboo death topics such as decomposition and necrophilia. By 2012, after 12 episodes, “Ask a Mortician” had 434,000 views, and by October 2018 the channel had 186 clips with a total of 57,000,000 views. Doughty uses an irreverent, offbeat and surreal tone to attract the largest possible audience for a subject that is otherwise off-putting and depressing to many potential viewers. Doughty said, “I take my job and this whole movement incredibly seriously. I do [the videos] with a sense of humor, but it’s my life, and it’s really important to me that a positive death message gets across.”</p><h2>Who is Caitlin Doughty Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Caitlin Doughty</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
