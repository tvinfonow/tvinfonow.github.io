Who is Alex Smith dating now & how much money does Alex Smith have?</p><h2>Alex Smith Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Alex Smith</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>May 7, 1984</strong> in Bremerton, Washington State, <strong>United States</strong>. NFL quarterback who helped lead the San Francisco 49ers to the NFC title game but was benched for <a href=#>Colin Kaepernick</a> the following year. He played for the Kansas City Chiefs from 2013 to 2017 before a trade sent him to the Washington Redskins.</p><p>He took the San Francisco 49ers to within one game of making the Super Bowl, but they lost to <a href=#>Eli Manning</a> in overtime of the 2012 NFC title game.</p><p>While the 49ers finished with their most wins since 1997, they did it while ranked 29th of 32 teams in the NFL in total passing yardage for 2011 (including yardage lost from sacks), and Smith was often cynically referred to as a game manager. In this manner, The New York Times wrote that Smith was “a steady, if unspectacular, player surrounded by a solid team” in 2011, whose career year “underscored how much he struggled previously.” It was his first season with over 3,000 yards passing, and he set personal single-season highs in virtually every relevant statistical category commonly cited for quarterbacks: in pass attempts with 445, in completions with 273, in completion percentage with 61.3&nbsp;percent, in passing yards with 3,144, in average per pass with 7.1 yards per attempt, in overall passer rating with 90.7, in rushing attempts with 52, in rushing yards with 179, and in total touchdowns scored with 19 (17 passing & 2 rushing), all while being sacked a league-high 44 times. He also threw a league-low 5 interceptions in 2011, breaking a 49ers franchise record, and setting yet another personal single-season best in fewest passes intercepted per attempt with a 1.123&nbsp;percent interception rate, likewise the lowest percentage in the league that year.</p><p>Smith attended the University of Utah and played for the Utah Utes, wearing number 11. He finished fourth in voting for the 2004 Heisman Trophy and was selected as the 2004 Mountain West Conference Player of the Year. Smith posted a 21–1 record as a starter in college, while leading a high-powered spread offense under head coach Urban Meyer. He led the Utes to victories in the 2003 Liberty Bowl and the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. Smith earned a bachelor’s degree in economics in two years with a 3.74 GPA, having matriculated with 64 credit hours earned before attending college, and began work on a master’s degree before being drafted.</p><p align=justify>He has a son named Hudson with his wife <a href=#>Elizabeth Barry</a>.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex Smith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Smith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bremerton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Douglas D.
