He is the father of Slipknot drummer Jay Weinberg.</p><p>The young Max was exposed to music early on, attending Broadway shows weekly from the age of two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He knew he wanted to be a drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on The Milton Berle Show in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, “I think anybody who wanted to develop a life in rock ‘n’ roll music had a moment. That was my moment,” and Fontana became a major influence on him. Weinberg has also acknowledged The Ventures as a major influence on him in an TV interview in 1988 to celebrate that band’s 30th anniversary and he actually sat in on drums during the performances.</p><p align=justify>In 1978, he married Becky Weinberg and had two children with her.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Max Weinberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Max</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Weinberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Newark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bertram Weinberg, Ruth Weinberg</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Becky Weinberg</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jay Weinberg, Ali Weinberg</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Max Weinberg ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Weinberg was still living at home when he met Bruce Springsteen on April 7, 1974 when his band, The Jim Marino Band, were Springsteen’s support at Seton Hall. Springsteen had parted ways with his drummer, Vini “Mad Dog” Lopez, earlier that year, and the replacement, Ernest “Boom” Carter, lasted only six months before leaving with pianist David Sancious to form Tone. Weinberg answered a Springsteen Village Voice newspaper ad that famously requested, “no junior Ginger Bakers,” in reference to Ginger Baker’s reputation for long drum solos. Weinberg auditioned with Springsteen and the core E Street Band in mid-late August of that year at the SIR studios in Midtown Manhattan, bringing a minimalist drum kit with him consisting only of hi-hats, a snare drum and a bass drum. He knew one Springsteen song from the Marino band, “Sandy”, and played it. His drumming on the Fats Domino song “Let the Four Winds Blow” sealed the position as his. A week later he was offered the $110 per week job (US$570 in 2019 dollars) and he quit college immediately, about six academic credits short of a degree. Weinberg’s first public performance came on September 19, 1974, at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Max Weinberg Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Max Weinberg is one of the <strong>richest Drummer</strong> from United States.

He grew up in Newark as well as in the neighboring suburban towns of South Orange and Maplewood.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$45 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Weinberg grew up in suburban New Jersey and began drumming at an early age. He attended college planning to be a lawyer but got his big break in music in 1974 when he won an audition to become the drummer for Springsteen. Weinberg became a mainstay of Springsteen’s long concert performances. Springsteen dissolved the band in 1989, and Weinberg spent several years considering a law career and trying the business end of the music industry before deciding he wanted to continue with drumming.</p><p>Weinberg rose to success as the drummer for Springsteen’s E Street Band, as his powerful yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band’s drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg’s drumming evoked two of his idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the “rock and roll lifestyle”; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, “Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money’s worth.” One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as “the Mighty Max”. Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, “What nobody understands is that not only is Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce’s mind. You can’t learn that.” Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Max Weinberg height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Max <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When the British Invasion hit in 1964, the Beatles and their drummer, Ringo Starr, became a huge influence on Weinberg. He began playing in local New Jersey rock bands, playing the music of The Rolling Stones, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, and The Young Rascals. While a member of The Epsilons, he played at the 1964 New York World’s Fair. He attended Columbia High School in Maplewood; there he knew Leigh Howard Stevens, who would become a famous percussionist in his own right. Weinberg graduated from Columbia High in 1969. Another band he was in, Blackstone, recorded an eponymous album for Epic Records in 1970.</p><p align=justify>Tempos slowed to an oft dirge-like pace on Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978); rehearsals and recording of the album stretched out over a long period, with Springsteen and bandmate and co-producer Steven Van Zandt experiencing a prolonged frustration over their inability to capture a more resonant drum sound. Weinberg soon regretted not playing faster on “Badlands”, and tempos did speed up on that number and some others during the accompanying Darkness Tour. He did later say that “It was a ballsy thing to play a single stroke roll through the entirety of ‘Candy’s Room’ ” and that it was the kind of choice a session musician never would have tried.</p><h2>Who is Max Weinberg Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Max Weinberg</strong> married to <strong>Becky Weinberg </strong>.

He drummed on the very popular 1977 Meat Loaf album, Bat Out of Hell, playing on the Steinman-penned tracks “Bat Out of Hell”, “You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth” and “Paradise by the Dashboard Light”. At a point in 1983, Weinberg was featured on the number one and number two songs on the Billboard Hot 100, Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” and Air Supply’s “Making Love Out of Nothing at All”, both Steinman creations. Weinberg also recorded with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, Gary U.S. Bonds, Ian Hunter and Carole King.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Max Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Drummer</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Max Weinberg celebrates birthday on April 13 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Weinberg suffered an acknowledged “drumming slump” around 1980, and his time-keeping skills were criticized by Springsteen. What could pass unnoticed in concert became apparent on record, and Weinberg practiced drumming components for months in order to regain a fine sense of timing. Weinberg also suffered from repetitive stress injury and tendinitis, eventually requiring seven operations on his hands and wrists. He studied for a while with noted jazz drummer Joe Morello; Weinberg credited Morello for helping him to learn how to play with the tendinitis. The River Tour Springsteen and E Street Band shows that opened New Jersey’s Meadowlands Arena in 1981 became one of the top highlights of Weinberg’s career.</p><h3>Where is Max Weinberg now?</h3><p>As of July 2020, Weinberg and his wife Becky live in <b>Delray Beach, Florida</b>.</p><h3>Is Max Weinberg a good drummer?</h3><p>Is Max Weinberg a good drummer? <b>Yes, Max is a legendary drummer and highly respected member of the drumming community</b>.
