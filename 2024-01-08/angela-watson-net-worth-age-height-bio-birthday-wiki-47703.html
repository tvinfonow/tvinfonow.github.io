Actress and model who gained fame for her performance in the role of Karen Foster on the hit show Step by Step.</p><p>She as well as&nbsp;Both she and <a href=#>Sasha Mitchell</a> starred on the sitcom Step by Step.&nbsp;starred in The sitcom Step by Step.</p><p>In Australia, Step by Step aired on the Seven Network from 1991 to 1995 and on the Nine Network from 1996 to 2000. In 2011, Step by Step was acquired by 7TWO. In 2015, 111 Greats started airing the whole series.</p><p>The series was created and executive produced by William Bickley and Michael Warren, and developed and executive produced by Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett. It was produced by Bickley-Warren Productions, Miller-Boyett Productions and Lorimar Television (the latter doing so from 1991 to 1993, when Warner Bros. Television assumed production responsibilities for it and Lorimar’s other television series after shared corporate parent Time Warner consolidated the two production companies). The casting of Patrick Duffy fulfilled a contractual obligation that Lorimar made to give him a new show after his previous series, Dallas (which was also produced by Lorimar), had ended its run. It was created off of the idea of combining two of the most popular television stars from the 1970s known for their good looks (Duffy and Somers) to star as parents to attract adult viewers, with current teen celebrities (Staci Keanan from My Two Dads and Going Places, Brandon Call from Baywatch and Sasha Mitchell from Dallas) to star as their children to attract children and teen viewers.</p><p align=justify>Her birthplace was Danville, Illinois, and was raised by her parents, Barbara Watson and Allen Watson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Angela Watson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Angela</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Watson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Danville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Barbara Watson, Allen Watson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brian Nahas</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Angela Watson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Domestic Television Distribution began distributing the series for broadcast in off-network syndication.</p><h2>Angela Watson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Angela Watson is one of the <strong>richest TV Actress</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Angela Watson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was a contestant on the beauty pageant circuit prior to becoming a regular on television networks.&nbsp;In actual fact, she won 60 crowns prior to her debut TV performance in the role of Karen Foster.</p><p align=justify>After learning that her parents had mismanaged and spent almost $3 million (her income through Step by Step), she set up Child Actors Supporting Themselves (CAST) An organization dedicated to helping actors of all ages manage their finances.</p><p align=justify>When the series was casting its characters, child actor Jarrett Lennon originally landed the role of Mark Foster. Lennon had been chosen by the producers after guest starring in the last original episode of the Miller-Boyett series The Hogan Family, which was produced in late 1990. After shooting the original (unaired) pilot for Step By Step, Lennon was dismissed from the role of Mark, and the producers later replaced him with Castile (who had blonde hair like on-screen mother Somers, as opposed to Lennon having brown hair). Most of Lennon’s pilot scenes were reshot with Castile, but during the first season, footage of Lennon remained in the show’s opening title sequence. Lennon only appeared in wide shots with the Lambert/Foster family or, in the case of Suzanne Somers’ credit scene, fleetingly appearing at the bottom of camera view as the kids huddled around Somers. All traces of Lennon were edited out by the second season. In 1996, these two actors had the tables turned on each other; Castile served as the original voice of Eugene Horowitz on the Nickelodeon animated series Hey Arnold!, but after a few episodes was replaced by Lennon, who voiced Eugene for the remainder of the show’s first season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>ABC chose to delay the series’ sixth season to the 1996–97 mid-season (premiering in March 1997), in order to make room on that season’s fall schedule for freshman sitcoms Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Clueless, which joined established series Family Matters and Boy Meets World on the TGIF lineup; the network canceled it after six seasons in May 1997, due to declining ratings. CBS concurrently reached a deal with Miller-Boyett Productions to acquire the rights to it and Family Matters from ABC, as that network attempted to build its own Friday night lineup of family-friendly situation comedies for the fall of 1997, called the “CBS Block Party”. The series’ ratings, which had been declining for several seasons, continued to erode, and the show ended its run in June 1998. It ended without an official series finale, although the last episode centered on Frank and Carol considering selling the house. According to Staci Keanan and Christine Lakin, the series was supposed to end with Dana and Rich’s wedding at the house, and elaborate preparations were underway for it prior to the series’ abrupt end.</p><p>Warner Home Video released a six-episode Television Favorites collection on DVD on June 27, 2006. Warner Archive Collection has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1. These are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available from Warner’s online store and Amazon.com.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Angela Watson height</b> <strong>5 ft 4 in</strong> Angela <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 4 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Step by Step is an American television sitcom that aired for seven seasons.
