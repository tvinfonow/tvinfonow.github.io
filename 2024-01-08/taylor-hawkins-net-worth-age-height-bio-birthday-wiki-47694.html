Conflict during studio recording reportedly erupted between Dave Grohl and drummer William Goldsmith, eventually causing Goldsmith to leave the band. The band regrouped in Los Angeles and almost completely re-recorded the album with Grohl on drums. The album, The Colour and the Shape, was released on May 20, 1997. Grohl called up Hawkins to recommend a new drummer, thinking that Hawkins would not leave Alanis Morissette since it’s a bigger band compared to Foo Fighters, which was only starting at the time. But to Grohl’s surprise, Hawkins volunteered himself, explaining that he wanted to be a drummer in a rock band, not a solo act which Alanis Morissette is. He then auditioned for and subsequently joined the band. On March 18, 1997, Hawkins’ joining of the band was announced. Hawkins made his debut in time for the album’s release.</p><h2>Taylor Hawkins Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Taylor Hawkins is one of the <strong>richest Drummer</strong> from United States.
