Who is Brett Gurewitz dating now & how much money does Brett Gurewitz have?</p><h2>Brett Gurewitz Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Brett Gurewitz</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Guitarist</strong> who was born on <strong>May 12, 1962</strong> in Los Angeles, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Guitarist and co-songwriter for the punk rock band Bad Religion.</p><p>He played alongside drummer <a href=#>Brooks Wackerman</a> in Bad Religion.</p><p>Then-18-year-old Brett Gurewitz formed Bad Religion in Woodland Hills in 1980 with Greg Graffin (vocals), Jay Ziskrout (drums) and Jay Bentley (bass). All four attended El Camino Real High School. Soon after, they began writing songs and played their first ever concert, as warm-up for Social Distortion. In 1981, Bad Religion recorded a six-song self-titled EP, which was initially released in a 7″ format, and soon afterward re-issued as a 12″. Compact cassettes were also produced, but they are rare.</p><p>Gurewitz founded Bad Religion in 1980 with Greg Graffin, Jay Bentley and Jay Ziskrout. After releasing two albums and one EP, Gurewitz left Bad Religion in 1983, but rejoined three years later, and recorded five more albums with the band before they signed to Atlantic Records in 1993. The success of his record label Epitaph prompted Gurewitz to leave Bad Religion once again in 1994, and run his label on a full-time basis. During his hiatus from Bad Religion, he released the “Hate You” single in 1996 with his one-off project Daredevils, and entered a period of drug addiction. By 1999, Gurewitz had successfully completed drug rehabilitation. He eventually rejoined the band in 2001 to write and record the album The Process of Belief (2002). He remains with the band today for occasional studio recordings.</p><p align=justify>He has been married twice.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brett Gurewitz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brett</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gurewitz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gina Davis , Maggie Gurewitz</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Frida Gurewitz, Max Gurewitz</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brett Gurewitz ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

While recording one song, Bentley and Finestone left the band and were replaced by Paul Dedona on bass and Davy Goldman on drums. The album, Into the Unknown is out of print, but is included in their 30th anniversary box set.</p><h2>Brett Gurewitz Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Brett Gurewitz is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United States.

Soon after, Bad Religion went on hiatus again.</p><p>After the How Could Hell Be Any Worse? line-up (also including Hetson) reunited in 1986, Bad Religion released their highly acclaimed album Suffer in 1988. The album was a comeback for Bad Religion as well as a watershed for the Southern California punk sound popularized by their label Epitaph Records, owned by Gurewitz. The reunion line-up recorded two more highly acclaimed albums, No Control (1989) and Against the Grain (1990), before Finestone left the group in early 1991.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Brett Gurewitz height</b> Not available right now.

When recording sessions commenced, Ziskrout soon left the band and was replaced by Pete Finestone. Cited as one of Bad Religion’s most important works, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? was financed by a $3,000 loan from Gurewitz’s father. Its success surprised the band when it sold 10,000 copies in under a year. The sound of the record was vastly improved from the self-titled EP. Although not yet credited as a member of the band, Greg Hetson (of Circle Jerks fame) did a guitar solo on “Part III”.</p><p align=justify>Bad Religion rose to fame with their next album, 1994’s Stranger Than Fiction, including their well-known hits “Infected” and “21st Century (Digital Boy)”, which are also often considered concert staples. After the album was completed, Gurewitz soon left Bad Religion to concentrate on the future of Epitaph, citing the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph’s offices as The Offspring became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker during the Stranger Than Fiction tour and Bad Religion recorded two albums without him.</p><h2>Who is Brett Gurewitz Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Brett Gurewitz</strong> married to <strong>Gina Davis , Maggie Gurewitz </strong>.
