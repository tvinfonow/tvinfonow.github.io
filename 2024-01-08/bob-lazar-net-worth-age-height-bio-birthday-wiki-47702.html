Who is Bob Lazar dating now & how much money does Bob Lazar have?</p><h2>Bob Lazar Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Bob Lazar</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Scientist</strong> who was born on <strong>January 26, 1959</strong> in Coral Gables, Florida, <strong>United States</strong>. Robert Scott Lazar (/l @ “‘ z a:r / ; born on January 26, 1959) is an American conspiracy theorist who claims to have been commissioned in the latter part of the 1980s to reverse engineer alleged extraterrestrial technology in the secret location he known as “S-4”.&nbsp;Lazar asserts that this subordinate installation is situated a few kilometers from the United States Air Force facility that is known in the United States Air Force as Area 51.</p><p>Lazar has earned notoriety for his role for his work as the Area 51 conspiracy theorist.&nbsp;He was featured during an interview conducted by investigative journalist George Knapp on Las Vegas television station KLAS using an assumed name of “Dennis” and with his face concealed in order to discuss his claimed job in “S-4”, a subsidiary facility that he claimed is located close to the Nellis Air Force Base installation called Area 51.&nbsp;Lazar claimed that the S-4 facility was located next to Papoose Lake, which is located to the south of the primary Area 51 facility at Groom Lake.&nbsp;The site was said to consist of hidden hangars for aircraft that were constructed into the mountainside.&nbsp;Lazar claimed that his work was to assist in the reverse engineering or nine flying saucers that he claimed were extraterrestrial in their origins.&nbsp;Lazar claims that some of them, one he named”the “Sport Model”, was made from an alloy that resembles in appearance and feel similar to the stainless steel.&nbsp;In an interview later in October, Lazar came out unmasked using his own name.</p><p>Lazar’s story has since been analyzed and rejected by skeptics and some ufologists. Universities from which he claims to hold degrees show no record of him, and supposed former workplaces have disavowed him. In 1990, he was convicted for his involvement in a prostitution ring and again in 2006 for selling illegal chemicals.</p><p>Lazar claimed that the propulsion of the studied vehicle was fueled by the chemical element with atomic number 115, or “E115”, which at the time was provisionally named ununpentium and had not yet been artificially created (it was first synthesized in 2003 and later named moscovium). He said that the propulsion system relied on a stable isotope of E115, which allegedly generates a gravity wave that allowed the vehicle to fly and to evade visual detection by bending light around it. No stable isotopes of moscovium have yet been synthesized; all have proven extremely radioactive, decaying in a few hundred milliseconds.</p><p align=justify>Lazar and long-time pal Gene Huff run Desert Blast the annual event located in the Nevada desert that is a gathering place for enthusiasts of pyrotechnics.&nbsp;Beginning in 1987, and officially named only in 1991 the name was influenced from Operation Desert Storm.&nbsp;The festival includes homemade rockets, explosives, jet-powered vehicles and other pyrotechnics with the goal of highlighting the fun aspects of Physics and Chemistry.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bob Lazar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bob</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lazar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scientist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Coral Gables</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Albert Lazar, Phyllis Berliner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joy White</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bob Lazar ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
