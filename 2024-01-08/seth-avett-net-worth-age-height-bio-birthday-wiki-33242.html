Avett sings and plays guitar, drums, and piano for the band based out of Concord, North Carolina. In 2008, their album, The Second Gleam, reached the number ten spot on Billboard.com’s Top Independent Albums chart, and stayed there for three weeks.</p><p>Seth and Scott were heavily involved with their respective bands during their college years. During this time, Scott was playing with Nemo in Greenville and Seth was involved with the Charlotte-based band Margo, which was started by high school friends. Seth Avett was lead singer and played lead guitar, Noah Warner was drummer/guitarist/singer/writer, Kenny Graham was back-up guitarist, and Ben Sawyer was bass guitarist. Seth and Noah grew up best friends from about the 5th grade, they played soccer together and started playing music together. While in high school they started their first band, “Nothing”. They eventually changed to the Margo moniker putting on shows at the local Lions Club and then started playing bars in Charlotte with parents in tow, even winning the local high school Battle of the Bands talent show. Margo had the song “Dumbfight” published on a compilation album with the California production company Rodelle Records. (Scott has been quoted classifying Margo’s music as “melodic rock”.) The Brothers, along with guitarist/founding member John Twomey, decided to merge the bands while maintaining the name “Nemo” in 1998.[10] The Avett Brothers were formed during the Nemo days with fellow Nemo guitarist/founding member, John Twomey. During that time, the name was changed to The Avett Brothers while Nemo and The Avett Brothers continued touring as separate bands. Bob Crawford later joined that band in 2001 as Twomey quit both bands and Nemo dissolved. Eventually, Nemo disbanded and, with the addition of acoustic instruments and bassist Bob Crawford of Charlotte, The Avett Brothers were formed. In 2003, The Avett Brothers were introduced to Dolph Ramseur, the owner of Ramseur Records, an independent record label in Concord. Since the year 2000, The Avett Brothers have released eleven albums (seven with Ramseur) and have enjoyed ever-growing popularity and success. In late 2007, The Avett Brothers added cellist Joe Kwon, a graduate of the University of North Carolina and then-member of “Big Pretty and the Red Rockets”, to their roster. This success has included a 2007 appearance on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, a 2008 signing to the Columbia record label, and having the number one album (Emotionalism) on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart. The Avett Brothers have toured with Portland band Sallie Ford and the Sound Outside.
