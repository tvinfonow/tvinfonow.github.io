Egyptian terrorist and hijacker responsible in the September 11th 2001 attacks on World Trade Center.</p><p>In 1999, he met He met al-Quaeda mastermind <a href=#>Osama bin Laden</a> in Afghanistan in 1999.&nbsp;, al-Quaeda mastermind&nbsp;while in Afghanistan.</p><p>Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el-Sheikh, located in Egypt’s Nile Delta region. His father, Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta, was a lawyer, educated in both sharia and civil law. His mother, Bouthayna Mohamed Mustapha Sheraqi, came from a wealthy farming and trading family and was also educated. Bouthayna and Mohamed married when she was 14, via an arranged marriage. The family had few relatives on the father’s side and kept their distance from Bouthayna’s family. In-laws characterized Atta’s father as “austere, strict, and private,” and neighbors viewed the family as reclusive. Atta was the only son; he had two older sisters who are both well-educated and successful in their careers — one as a medical doctor and the other as a professor.</p><p>Mohamed Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta (/ˈ æ t ɑː / AT -ah; Arabic: محمد محمد الأمير عوض السيد عطا ‎ Muḥammad Muḥammad al-Amir ‘Awaḍ as-Sayyid ‘Aṭā [mæˈħæmmæd elʔæˈmiːɾ ˈʕɑwɑdˤ esˈsæj.jed ˈʕɑtˤɑ] ; September 1, 1968 – September 11, 2001) was an Egyptian hijacker and one of the ringleaders of the September 11 attacks in which four United States commercial aircraft were commandeered with the intention of destroying specific civilian and military targets. He served as the hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11 which he crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated attacks. At 33 years of age, he was the oldest of the 19 hijackers who took part in the attacks.</p><p align=justify>His father was an Egyptian lawyer.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mohamed Atta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mohamed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Atta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Egypt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bouthayna Mohamed Mustapha Sheraqi, Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Azza Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta, Mona Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mohamed Atta ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Mohamed Atta's ethnicity is <strong>Middle Eastern</strong>. We will update Mohamed Atta's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>At the Hamburg University of Technology, Atta studied under the guidance of the department chair, one Dittmar Machule, who specialized in the Middle East. Atta was averse to modern development. This included the construction of high-rise buildings in Cairo and other ancient cities in the region. He believed that the drab and impersonal apartment blocks, built in the 60s and 70s, ruined the beauty of old neighborhoods and robbed their people of privacy and dignity. Atta’s family moved into one such eyesore in 1990; it was to him but “a shabby symbol of Egypt’s haphazard attempts to modernize and its shameless embrace of the West.” For his thesis, Atta concentrated on the ancient Syrian city of Aleppo. He researched the history of the urban landscape in relation to the general theme of conflict between Arab and modern civilization. He criticized how the newfangled skyscrapers and other modernizing projects were disrupting the fabric of communities by blocking common streets and altering the skyline.</p><h2>Mohamed Atta Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mohamed Atta is one of the <strong>richest Criminal</strong> from Egypt. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Mohamed Atta</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He studied engineering at Cairo University.</p><p align=justify>He was the hijacker for American Airlines Flight 11 and flew into North Tower of World Trade Center.</p><p align=justify>Atta and Omari arrived early the next morning, at 5:40&nbsp;a.m., at Portland International Jetport, where they left their rental car in the parking lot and boarded a 6:00&nbsp;a.m. Colgan Air (US Airways Express) BE-1900C flight to Boston’s Logan International Airport. In Portland, Mohamed Atta was selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), which required his checked bags to undergo extra screening for explosives but involved no extra screening at the passenger security checkpoint.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Born and raised in Egypt, Atta studied architecture at Cairo University, graduating in 1990, and continued his studies in Germany at the Hamburg University of Technology. In Hamburg, Atta became involved with the al-Quds Mosque, where he met Marwan al-Shehhi, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Ziad Jarrah, together forming the Hamburg cell. Atta disappeared from Germany for periods of time, embarking on the hajj in 1995 but also meeting Osama bin Laden and other top al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan from late 1999 to early 2000. Atta and the other Hamburg cell members were recruited by bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for a “planes operation” in the United States. Atta returned to Hamburg in February 2000, and began inquiring about flight training in the United States.</p><p>After coming to Hamburg in 1992, Atta grew more religiously fanatical and frequented the mosque with greater regularity. His friends in Germany described him as an intelligent man in whom religious convictions and political motives held equal sway. He harbored anger and resentment toward the U.S. for its policy in Islamic nations of the Middle East, with nothing inflaming his ire more than the Oslo Accords and the Gulf War in particular. He was also angry and bitter at the elite in his native Egypt, who hoarded all the power for themselves, as well as at the Egyptian government, that cracked down on the dissident Muslim Brotherhood.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mohamed Atta height</b> Not available right now.

His father, who kept the family ever insulated, forbade young Atta to fraternize with the other children in their neighborhood. Having little else to do, he mostly studied at home and easily excelled in school. In 1985, Atta enrolled at Cairo University and focused his studies on engineering. He was among the highest-scoring students; by his senior year, he was admitted to an exclusive architecture program. After he graduated in 1990 with an architecture degree, he joined the Engineers Syndicate, an organization under the control of the Muslim Brotherhood. He then worked for several months at the Urban Development Center in Cairo, where he joined various building projects and dispatched diverse architectural tasks. Also in 1990, Atta’s family moved into the eleventh floor of an apartment building in the Egyptian city of Giza.</p><p align=justify>Atta graduated from Cairo University with marks insufficient for the graduate program. As his father insisted that he go abroad for graduate studies, Atta, to this end, entered a German-language program at the Goethe Institute in Cairo. In 1992, his father had overheard a German couple who were visiting Egypt’s capital. The couple explained at dinner that they ran an exchange program and invited Atta to continue his studies in Germany; they also offered him room and board at their home in the city. Mohamed Atta accepted and was in Germany two weeks later, in July.</p><h2>Who is Mohamed Atta Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mohamed Atta</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged. As of December 1, 2023, Mohamed Atta’s is not dating anyone.</p><strong>Relationships Record</strong>: We have no records of <strong>past relationships</strong> for Mohamed Atta. You may help us to build the dating records for Mohamed Atta!<p>While in Hamburg, Atta held several positions, such as one part-time job at Plankontor, as well as another at an urban planning firm, beginning in 1992. He was let go from the firm in 1997, however, because its business had declined and “his draughtsmanship was not needed” after it bought a CAD system. Among other odd jobs to supplement his income, Atta sometimes worked at a cleaning company and sometimes bought and sold cars. Atta had harbored a desire to return to his native city, ever since he finished his studies in Hamburg; but he was prevented by the dearth of job prospects in Cairo, his family lacking the “right connections” to avail the customary nepotism. Further, after the Egyptian government had imprisoned droves of political activists, he knew better than to trust it not to target him too, with his social and political beliefs being such as they were.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Mohamed Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Criminal</strong>.

He stayed there until 1998. During that period, his roommates grew annoyed with him. He seldom bathed, and they could not bear his “complete, almost aggressive insularity”. He kept to himself to such an extent that he would turn away from a salutation with supercilious silence.</p><h3>What did Mohamed Atta do?</h3><p>He was the <b>hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11</b> which he crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated attacks.
