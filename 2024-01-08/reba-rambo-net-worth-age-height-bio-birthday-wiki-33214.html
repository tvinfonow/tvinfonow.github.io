In 1967, the group toured Vietnam, performing for the troops. It was from that experience that Reba began writing her first song. “Keep on Marching Home” was set to the minor chords popular in the folk music that she had begun listening to. Upon returning home, she played it for The Rambos’ producer, Bob MacKenzie, who was creative director of John T. Benson’s Heart Warming Records, the label The Rambos recorded for. MacKenzie was already aware of congregations organizing folk masses and had first explored this new form of gospel a year prior when he recorded The New Folk, a group formed by the Campus Crusade for Christ. He suggested a folk-centered solo project for fifteen-year-old Reba. The finished product was titled On the Folk Side of Gospel and released in 1968. Billboard called the album “extremely beautiful” and praised the way she “encroaches deeply into the folk field, yet keeps close to the spirit.” In an October 1968 feature on The Rambos, Billboard later wrote that Reba “held the belief that gospel music could be presented in a folk manner, and then she proved it.”</p><p>The Gospel Music Association Dove Awards were created in 1969 by the Gospel Music Association to honor the outstanding achievements in Christian music. As a solo artist, Rambo has received two awards from eight nominations.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reba Rambo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rhys</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sharpe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dawson Springs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kentucky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dottie Rambo, Buck Rambo</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dony McGuire</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Destiny Rambo McGuire, Israel Anthem McGuire</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Reba Rambo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 1976, Rambo’s album Lady became one of the best-selling contemporary and inspirational albums of the year, with Reba being Record World Magazine’s #1 Top Female Contemporary Artist. Unlike her contemporaries in Jesus Music who had a folk-centered sound, Lady revealed a new possibility for this expanding genre, incorporating elements of jazz, soul and light rock. The album featured the song “The Land Of Oohs and Ahs”, using imagery from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to depict heaven and the spiritual life. Record World called Rambo “one of the most important female contemporary Christian artists in the field today” in a 1977 feature. Lady won a Dove Award for Contemporary Album of the Year, and the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance, Contemporary or Inspirational. Lady established Reba as the premier “adult contemporary singer” in Christian music.</p><h2>Reba Rambo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Reba Rambo is one of the <strong>richest Singer</strong> from United States.

Lady’s follow-up, The Lady is a Child, released in January of 1978, was given an ample budget by the Benson Company, allowing Reba to really display the full range of her talent and imagination. From the 1940s Andrews Sisters-styled “All Day Dinner,” to the disco epic “Child of the Music Maker” to the Black gospel of “Go Ye” and then to the sophisticated string-sweetened title track, Reba raised the bar for what artistry within Jesus Music could look like. Campus Life Magazine called it “impressively orchestrated,” comparing Reba to Barbra Streisand, declaring “the lady is a singer.” Cash Box also noted the comparisons to Streisand and Diana Ross, but said “Reba, the singer, is original; and Reba, the writer, brilliant…the album is a classic.” The album would earn a Grammy nomination and would once again make Reba Record World Magazine’s Top Female Artist (Contemporary) of 1978. The Lady is a Child would also be used as part of an audio/visual test in mainstream retail outlets. In-store displays for the album made sales jump “sevenfold,” according to Billboard Magazine. “The Reba (Rambo) experience demonstrates…that that in-store projectors can create demand for a relatively unknown artist whose albums do not normally figure in mass merchandise outlets.”</p><p>Aside from the interior booklet, the album cover itself caused a controversy when it arrived in Christian bookstores. The cover showed Reba in a tattered dress, sitting in a pile of trash, holding a dead bird. Shot at Union Station, an abandoned Nashville train station, the cover was deemed inappropriate and the record company swiftly replaced the cover with a plain Black cover with a centered headshot of Reba. While initially charting at #12 with a bullet on Cash Box’s July 14th, 1979 Inspirational Albums chart, the album only stayed on the chart for six weeks. It would be the last of her solo albums to chart to date. She promoted the album on The PTL Club and The 700 Club and performed for President Jimmy Carter at the White House in September of that year.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Reba Rambo height</b> Not available right now.

She said in an interview in 1971 that she never had formal training in music: “All I know was taught to me by Mom and Daddy.”</p><p align=justify>Ralph Carmichael at Light Records, home to gospel luminaries Andraé Crouch and the Hawkins Family, however, was thrilled to sign Reba, despite the controversy, in early 1980. He told CCM Magazine, “Reba is the most progressive contemporary female artist in the gospel field today. I want Reba to stay in the field and use all the talents God has given her. She can have a tremendous influence.” She went to work on her first two projects for Light, both in collaboration with Dony McGuire, who had also moved to Light from Greentree Records. The first was a musical concept album called The Lord’s Prayer, the second was a new solo album which would be titled Confessions. An interview with CCM Magazine while working on the Light projects doesn’t directly mention the divorce or the aftermath. The writer only states that “Reba’s first solo LP on Light Records…records Reba’s very personal and sometimes painful journey through the last three years, leading her towards a personal, spiritual victory which she says is just now beginning.”</p><h2>Who is Reba Rambo Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Reba Rambo</strong> married to <strong>Dony McGuire </strong>.

One disc jockey told Billboard that “after Light Records artist Reba Rambo was divorced and remarried, the station quit playing her records despite her overall popularity and acceptance in the gospel field.” Reviews of the new projects passively fueled the controversy, referencing McGuire as Rambo’s “new husband and long-time co-songwriter.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Rhys Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Singer</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Reba Rambo celebrates birthday on October 17 of every year.</p><p align=justify>She recorded her last solo album, titled Lady Live, in June of 1981 at the Anaheim Convention Center in California for an audience of almost ten thousand. Contemporary Christian Music Magazine called the album “Reba’s most convincing and powerful project yet,” and said that “it does not take a connoisseur of fine music to appreciate the amount of practice, rehearsal and real work needed to pull together such a class act.” Billboard gushed that “her voice sweeps, soars and suspends itself effortlessly,” complimenting her “easy and affectionate interplay with her audience.” The more conservative Charisma Magazine, however, wrote a scathing review. The critic said that the album was “self-important” and “as shallow as a West Texas stock pond.” They further described her singing as “shrieking and cajoling,” and purported that “Reba consistently oversings every song, sending her thin little voice through all sort of vocal contortions.” The review seemed more of a response to Reba’s mainstream success and not the album itself. “Reba is hot right now,” he wrote, “her personal appearances are drawing large crowds and a number of artists are recording her songs. Light Records packaged this live album with a handsome set of graphics and a Hollywood-styled cover. All for naught.”</p><h3>Is Reba Rambo still married to Donnie Mcguire?</h3><p><b>In 2019, Reba and Dony divorced</b>.</p><h3>What is Reba Rambo doing now?</h3><p>Reba continues to <b>compose and write songs</b>, including several new collaborations with Bill and Gloria Gaither as well as other well known writers across all genres of music.
