Mark Thomas DeRosa (born February 26th 1975) is an American former professional baseball player.&nbsp;DeRosa typically played second base and third however, he also played at every position , except central field, pitcher and catcher.&nbsp;He is currently employed by MLB Network as a personality on MLB Central.</p><p>DeRosa later signed with his team, the Texas Rangers.&nbsp;He played only a few games due to injuries in 2005, which prevented his participation in the lineup in the beginning.</p><p>Finally healthy in May 2006, he received the opportunity to start. DeRosa responded to this by hitting well over .300 for the first half of the season. At season’s end, he topped his career high in RBI with 74, eclipsing his previous career high of 31. DeRosa also set a career high in home runs, with 13, and batted a respectable .296. He set a career high with 40 doubles.</p><p>On December 31, 2008, DeRosa was traded to the Cleveland Indians for minor league pitchers Jeff Stevens, Chris Archer, and John Gaub. Playing third base for the Indians, DeRosa collected his first hit with the Tribe on April 10 and his first home run on April 12. In addition to playing 3rd base for the Indians, he also spent time at first base and in the outfield. Many early-season injuries to Indians regulars caused DeRosa to be moved around the field and the batting order throughout the season. In spite of this, he was on pace to make 2009 his most productive season yet.</p><p align=justify>DeRosa began this season in the role of the primary third-baseman with the Braves.&nbsp;He had been a backup for the previous couple of seasons, however the loss of Vinny Castilla made room for DeRosa.&nbsp;The way he played as a starting pitcher was thought to be unacceptably.&nbsp;DeRosa himself admitted to his performance and said in one interview his mother couldn’t say that she thought that he was performing good.&nbsp;After approximately a month DeRosa was promoted to the position of a backup.&nbsp;Chipper Jones was moved into third place from the left side which was where he played throughout his entire career, until 2002.&nbsp;Jones was substituted on the left side by a team of Charles Thomas, an unknown rookie as well as Eli Marrero, a fairly obscure outfielder/catcher who was thought of as the lesser-important part of the deal in which the Braves purchased him and J. D. Drew in exchange for the pitchers Jason Marquis, Ray King along with Adam Wainwright.&nbsp;The end of 2004 saw the Braves resigning DeRosa the Braves did not offer DeRosa an option to sign a contract for the 2005 season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark DeRosa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>DeRosa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Passaic</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Heidi Derosa</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gabriella Faith DeRosa</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mark DeRosa ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
