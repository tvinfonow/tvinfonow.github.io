They reached the Stanley Cup Finals but were defeated by the Colorado Avalanche.</p><p>Buffalo missed the playoffs in the three seasons preceding the 2004–05 NHL lockout amidst the team’s bankruptcy and financial problems caused by the Adelphia Communications corporate scandal. After the lockout, Ruff lead the Sabres to back-to-back Eastern Conference Finals appearances only to lose to the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006 and the Ottawa Senators in 2007. Ruff was the longest-tenured coach in the NHL and was rewarded with a three-year contract extension that had an option for a fourth season.</p><p>Ruff was the winner of the 2005–06 Jack Adams Award for coach of the year in the NHL.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Lindy Ruff</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>The Buffalo Sabres selected Ruff in the 32nd round of the 1979 NHL Entry Draft.&nbsp;Ruff played for both the Sabres, and the New York Rangers.&nbsp;Ruff was known for his character, toughness and dedication to the game.&nbsp;This was evident in a May 10, 1980 playoff game against New York Islanders when Billy Smith, the opposing goaltender, struck Ruff with his stick while he was passing in front of his net.&nbsp;Ruff jumped up and skated back towards the goaltender, where he was tackled.</p><p align=justify>Ruff’s younger brother Brent Ruff was among four players who were killed in a bus accident while playing for Swift Current Broncos.</p><p align=justify>Ruff was named the 15th head coach of the Buffalo Sabres on July 21, 1997. He joined a long list of former Sabres players who eventually became Sabres head coaches: Floyd Smith, Bill Inglis, Craig Ramsay, Jim Schoenfeld and Rick Dudley. He had immediate success in Buffalo, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals in the 1997–98 season. In Ruff’s second season as coach, the Sabres reached the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals before finally losing to the Dallas Stars in six games. The Stars’ Brett Hull scored a goal deep into the third overtime. Hull’s skate was in the goaltender’s crease, but had control of the puck, which was (under then 1999 rules prior to a late-March NHL memo) a clear violation, giving Dallas the Stanley Cup. The following two seasons saw Ruff’s Sabres lose in the first round to the Philadelphia Flyers and the second round to the Pittsburgh Penguins, respectively.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ice Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ruff was again nominated for the Jack Adams Award in 2006–07.

A well-known example of his bluntness were his comments regarding Toronto Maple Leafs player Darcy Tucker. In his post-game interview following a questionable hit on Jochen Hecht that knocked the Sabres centre out of the lineup for two weeks with a sprained ACL in the 2005–06 season, Ruff said, “I want him [Tucker] suspended.” He also said, “I have not called the NHL office all year and I will call them ten times tomorrow.” He called Tucker’s hit “an absolute joke”.</p><p align=justify>In February 2007, Ruff was fined US$10,000 by the NHL after a brawl with the Ottawa Senators. The NHL said Ruff precipitated the brawl following a questionable hit on then co-captain Chris Drury by the Senators’ Chris Neil. Because the hit to Drury did not result in a penalty, Ruff sent out Andrew Peters, Patrick Kaleta and Adam Mair, the team’s “enforcers”. What followed was one of the 2006–07 season’s most memorable hockey brawls. Mair began the brawl, punching Ottawa’s Jason Spezza as soon as the puck was dropped. Peters tried to start a fight with Dany Heatley, who was reluctant to respond, at one point even hiding behind a linesman. The goaltenders also entered the fight, with Martin Biron challenging Ray Emery, and Ruff himself engaged in a prolonged shouting match with Senators head coach Bryan Murray.. A large contingent of Sabres fans attempted to raise money to pay the fine on Ruff’s behalf. Ruff declined the fans’ offer and had the money raised donated to charity.</p><h2>Who is Lindy Ruff Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lindy Ruff</strong> married to <strong>Gaye Ruff</strong>.
