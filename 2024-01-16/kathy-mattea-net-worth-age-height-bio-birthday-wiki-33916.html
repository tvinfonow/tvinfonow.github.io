Folk, bluegrass and Celtic artist who has been known for her top-selling hit songs “Goin’ Gone” and “Burnin’ Old Memories.”</p><p>Her song “Mary, Did You Know?”&nbsp;was performed by&nbsp;Her single “Mary, Did You Know?” was covered by <a href=#>Wynonna Judd</a>..</p><p>In 1976, while attending West Virginia University, she joined a bluegrass band, and two years later dropped out of school to move to Nashville. During this time, Mattea also listened to folk and bluegrass, which she would later say “formed [her] roots” as an artist. She worked as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame, and then as a secretary and a waitress, in order to support herself while working as a demo singer. Songwriter, publisher, and record producer Byron Hill discovered her and helped her sign to Mercury Records in 1983.</p><p>Mattea’s self-titled debut came out in 1984, with Hill and Rick Peoples as the album’s producers. Mattea later noted that “there were no budgets” when she was recording the album, as she was unable to afford a $75 makeup session, and the front cover featured her wearing a jacket which she had purchased at Kmart. Even so, four of its singles made the Hot Country Songs charts, starting with “Street Talk”, which charted at No.&nbsp;25. Mattea had originally recorded a demo of the song with the intent of having Terri Gibbs record it, but Mattea kept it for herself when Gibbs declined the song. Followup “Someone Is Falling in Love” (written by Pebe Sebert) made it to No.&nbsp;26 on the same chart, while “You’ve Got a Soft Place to Fall” and “That’s Easy for You to Say” fell short of the top 40. Other notable cuts on the album included “God Ain’t No Stained Glass Window”, which was released as a 12″ promotional single for the Christmas season; a cover version of Barry Manilow’s 1981 hit “Somewhere Down the Road”; and “(Back to the) Heartbreak Kid”, which later became a Top 10 hit on the country charts for Restless Heart in late 1985 to early 1986. Allmusic reviewer William Ruhlmann wrote of the album that it was “a fairly representative sampling of Nashville formula country writing”, while praising the “feisty” nature of “Street Talk” and Mattea’s vocals on “Heartbreak Kid”. People reviewer Ralph Novak compared Mattea’s voice favorably to Anne Murray and said that “Mattea may not have the most revolutionary sound around, but her material is especially good.”</p><p align=justify>She was raised living in Cross Lanes with her parents.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kathy Mattea</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kathy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mattea</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Charleston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>West Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>John Mattea, Ruth Mattea</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jon Vezner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kathy Mattea ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Four singles were released from the album. First was “Love at the Five and Dime”, written and originally recorded by Nanci Griffith on her 1986 album The Last of the True Believers. Following it were “Walk the Way the Wind Blows”, “You’re the Power”, and “Train of Memories”. All four of these songs reached the top 10 of the country music charts between 1986 and 1987. The B-side to “You’re the Power” was a rendition of “Song for the Life”, written by Rodney Crowell and later a top 10 hit for Alan Jackson in 1995. Contributing musicians on Walk the Way the Wind Blows included Béla Fleck, Don Williams (who sang background vocals on “Love at the Five and Dime”), Wendy Waldman, and Vince Gill. Billboard praised Walk the Way the Wind Blows as “Mattea’s most country effort to date”. An uncredited review in Stereo Review (now Sound & Vision) stated that “if every country album were as tasteful and well executed as Walk the Way the Wind Blows…the reviewer’s life would be a happy one indeed”, while rating the performance and recording as “perfection”. Thom Jurek felt that the album’s uptempo cuts were stronger than its ballads, noting that “Her ballad singing hadn’t gotten to the place it did just three years later” while praising her performances on the more upbeat tracks and on “Love at the Five and Dime”.</p><h2>Kathy Mattea Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kathy Mattea is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.
