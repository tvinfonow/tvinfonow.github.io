Magee and Lori Jenkins. He spent much of his life prior to the murders in the criminal justice system, which he first entered at age 7 after bringing a loaded .25 caliber handgun to his elementary school. At age 11, Jenkins was kicked out of a group home for repetitive violence, and stopped regularly attending school. By age 13 he had committed multiple assaults including one knife assault. Jenkins was sent to prison in 2003 for two armed carjackings after spending time in a youth detention facility. While incarcerated, he was charged twice: for his part in a 2006 prison riot, as well as for assaulting a prison guard while on a furlough for his grandmother’s funeral.</p><p>Jenkins’ fourth and final victim, Andrea Kruger, was discovered on August 21, at about 2:15&nbsp;a.m., by a deputy sheriff responding to a shots-fired call. Her body was found lying in the road at 168th and Fort Streets, with multiple bullet wounds. Kruger had been returning home after a bartending shift near 178th and Pacific Streets. Surveillance footage showed her locking up the Deja Vu Lounge at 1:47&nbsp;a.m. At 6:30 that evening Kruger’s gold 2012 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was found abandoned 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) away in an alley at 43rd and Charles Streets. Later that week, a news conference was held by Douglas County Sheriff Tim Dunning, in which he stated that investigators believed the SUV had been abandoned roughly 2.5 hours after being stolen, and that a “feeble attempt” had been made at setting the vehicle’s interior ablaze.</p><p align=justify>Lori, his mother Lori was indicted as a felon who was in possession of ammunition, in the year 2013.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nikko Jenkins</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nikko</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jenkins</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Colorado</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lori Jenkins, David Magee</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Erica Jenkins, Melonie Jenkins</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chalonda Jenkins</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Nikko Jenkins ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

By then, evidence against him had mounted—investigators had the image of a female associate on surveillance footage at a local gun outlet buying the kind of distinctive ammunition (Brenneke Classic Magnum 12-gauge, commonly known as “deer slugs”) that had been used to commit the killings. Additional footage had been pulled from cameras along the route to Kruger’s abandoned SUV. On the evening of September 3, Jenkins confessed to all four murders during a rambling 8-hour interview, attributing the acts as a sacrifice to Apophis.
