Who is Mark Ingram Sr. dating now & how much money does Mark Ingram Sr. have?</p><h2>Mark Ingram Sr. Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Mark Ingram Sr.</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>August 23, 1965</strong> in New Jersey, <strong>United States</strong>. A former NFL Wide receiver, who was a part of The New York Giants, the Miami Dolphins, the Green Bay Packers and the Philadelphia Eagles from 1987 until 1996.</p><p>He was mentored under&nbsp;Nick Saban&nbsp;at Michigan State University when Saban was an assistant.</p><p>Ingram was drafted by the Giants in the first round (28th overall) in the 1987 NFL Draft. He is probably best known for a third down play in Super Bowl XXV in which he eluded at least five Buffalo Bills defenders to achieve a critical first down for the Giants to sustain a long touchdown drive. He finished the game as the Giants top receiver with five catches for 77 yards. As a Miami Dolphin, in a game against the New York Jets, Ingram caught four touchdown passes from Dan Marino. The most notable was the game-winning touchdown, which was the result of Marino faking out the Jets defense by indicating he was going to spike the ball to stop the clock. Instead, he lobbed a short pass to Ingram, who was open in the end zone.</p><p>On September 16, 2008, Ingram was sentenced to seven years in prison and up to five years of probation for money laundering and fraud. He was also ordered in a Long Island federal court to pay $252,000 in restitution. Ingram failed to show up to a federal prison in Ashland, Kentucky to turn himself in on December 5, 2008, and an arrest warrant was issued. On January 2, 2009, Ingram was arrested in a Flint, Michigan hotel room, where he was preparing to watch his son play in the 2009 Sugar Bowl. Alabama lost the game to the Utah Utes by a score of 31–17. On March 22, 2010, in a courtroom in Central Islip, New York, Ingram was sentenced to an additional two years in prison for jumping bail to see his son, Mark Ingram Jr. play for Alabama. He was housed at Yazoo City Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) as inmate 22749-050, and was then in the custody of the Residential Reentry Management Detroit. Ingram was released from prison in early 2015.</p><p align=justify>He was the father of a son,&nbsp;Mark Ingram&nbsp;Jr. He would later be an NFL running back.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark Ingram Sr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Other Family Members</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Myla Ingram ( Grandchildren )</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mark Ingram Jr.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mark Ingram Sr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
