Starting on the Dakal tribe, Holland faced two tribal councils, but received no votes. After being switched to the Sele tribe following the Tribe Swap, he was reunited with his ex-girlfriend Michele Fitzgerald, though they were not on good terms, and Holland acted distant and rude to her. While received votes in the next two tribal councils, he survived elimination, thanks to his alliance with fellow Dakal Nick Wilson, and ability to settle his differences with Fitzgerald. He reached the merge, but was blindsided at the merged tribal council, due to Sophie Clarke feeling like he was too close to Jeremy Collins. He was eliminated in 13th place on day 35 after losing the second and final Edge of Extinction challenge. As a member of the jury, Holland cast his vote for eventual sole Survivor and two time winner Tony Vlachos.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reality Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Wendell Holland height</b> Not available right now.
