With more than 170,000,000 copies sold, she is a top-selling manga artist.</p><p>She was a member of the same generation as “Naruto’ creator&nbsp;Masashiki Kishimoto.</p><p>Takahashi’s professional career began in 1978. Her first published work was the one-shot Katte na Yatsura (Those Selfish Aliens), which garnered her an honorable mention at that year’s Shogakukan New Comics Contest. Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in Weekly Shōnen Sunday; Urusei Yatsura, a comedic science fiction story. She had difficulty meeting deadlines to begin with, so chapters were published sporadically until 1980. During the run of the series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often slept in a closet due to a lack of space. During the same year, she published Time Warp Trouble, Shake Your Buddha, and the Golden Gods of Poverty in Weekly Shōnen Sunday magazine, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.</p><p>During the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga. Her stories Laughing Target, Maris the Chojo, and Fire Tripper all were adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, during the writing of Urusei Yatsura and Maison Ikkoku, Takahashi took a different approach to storytelling and began the dark, macabre Mermaid Saga. This series of short segments was published sporadically until 1994.</p><p align=justify>When she was born, her family lived in Niigata.&nbsp;Soichiro, her husband, left her.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rumiko Takahashi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rumiko</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Takahashi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illustrator</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Niigata</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rumiko Takahashi ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
