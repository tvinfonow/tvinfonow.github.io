Who is Christian Siriano dating now & how much money does Christian Siriano have?</p><h2>Christian Siriano Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Christian Siriano</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Fashion Designer</strong> who was born on <strong>November 18, 1985</strong> in Annapolis, Maryland, <strong>United States</strong>. A fashion designer who is a member of Council of Fashion Designers of America who has been named the winner of the fourth season.</p><p>In the final episode in the final episode of Project Runway,&nbsp;In the finale of Project Runway, <a href=#>Victoria Beckham</a> stated that she would be honored to wear any piece of his clothing.&nbsp;declared her desire to be delighted to wear any of the pieces of his clothes.</p><p>In March 2008, Margaret Price, a columnist for Bitch magazine, wrote an editorial entitled, “Is Christian Siriano Making A Hot Mess of the Term ‘Tranny’?”, in which she stated that Siriano’s use of the terms “tranny” and “hot tranny mess” were offensive to the transsexual community and that by using the terms he was popularizing an “as-yet unclaimed slur.” In a May 2008 interview with Time Out New York, Siriano responded to a question about the lasting power of drag culture by stating, “If you think of heterosexuals, they have white-trash women and trailer parks, and we have drag queens and trannies. I don’t know if I’m the one who can explain it. It’s, like, drag queens are just there.” The remark garnered criticism for its derogatory slang and its comparison of transsexuality and drag queen culture to “white-trash” and trailer parks. Siriano released an apology to GLAAD in which he stated, “I mean no disrespect to the transgender community and I never will.” Of his comments in the article, Siriano said, “I wish that my words were not taken in that way. When I was speaking, some comments that I made were not used in the article.” He further commented that he is “actively working to remove” the term “tranny” from his vocabulary.</p><p>Siriano began to receive pop culture attention during his time on Project Runway, primarily for his asymmetrical upswept hair-do and his flamboyant attitude. Several of Siriano’s catchphrases were parodied in the media by multiple blogs and television shows like Saturday Night Live, on which Amy Poehler portrayed Siriano. On May 1, 2008, Siriano appeared as himself on season 2 episode 15 of Ugly Betty, and designed some of the cast’s costumes (including Amanda Tanen’s blouse, which was sold in an auction on the internet).
