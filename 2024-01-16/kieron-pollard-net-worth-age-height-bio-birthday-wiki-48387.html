Cricketer who was the joint highest paid player in the Indian Premier League in 2010. He made his ODI debut for the West Indies in 2007.</p><p>He and <a href=#>Lasith Malinga</a> have been teammates on the Mumbai Indians.</p><p>Pollard was born in Trinidad and Tobago, where he was raised, along with two younger sisters, in a poor home by his single mother. Speaking about it, Pollard reflects “It was pretty tough, it wasn’t ideal getting up and your mum say ‘We only have X of money’.” After representing Trinidad and Tobago in the 2005 TCL Group West Indies Under-19 Challenge, he was selected as part of the West Indies Under-19 cricket team to tour Pakistan. Pollard top-scored for the West Indies in the first youth One Day International (ODI), scoring 53&nbsp;runs off 49&nbsp;balls. Pollard made another half-century in the second match, but didn’t manage to make double figures in either of last two games. He was named in the West Indies squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup, held in Sri Lanka, where he only managed to make 19–runs in his four innings, though he did manage to take two wickets in a defeat to Australia.</p><p>During the 2006 English season he came to England to play for Haxey CC in Lincolnshire; he played five games for the club before he was recalled by Trinidad and Tobago to play in the Stanford Twenty20. Pollard made his senior debut for Trinidad and Tobago in the twenty20 competition against the Cayman Islands in July 2006. He finished the tournament with a respectable return of six wickets, and starred in the semi-final against Nevis, scoring 83&nbsp;runs off just 38&nbsp;balls, an innings which included 7&nbsp;sixes to book Trinidad and Tobago’s place in the final. He made his first-class debut six months later against Barbados, and marked the occasion with a century. As in the Twenty20, his innings contained a large number of boundaries, with 86 of his 126 runs coming from either fours or sixes. A score of 46 not out on his List A debut ensured that Pollard was in the selector’s minds for the upcoming World Cup, and he described it as “a dream come true” when he was selected in the provisional 30-man squad for the tournament. Pollard’s “dream run” continued with half-centuries in both four-day and 50-over matches against Guyana, followed by his second first-class century, coming against the Leeward Islands. Against Jamaica, Pollard showed his bowling ability, claiming four wickets in his seven overs to claim his fifth man of the match award in his 15th senior match. Trinidad and Tobago remained unbeaten in the 2006–07 KFC Cup, beating Windward Islands in the final to claim the trophy. Pollard finished as the competition’s leading run-scorer, making 261&nbsp;runs from his seven innings at an average of over 40.</p><p align=justify>He grew up in a single-parent household in Tacarigua, Trinidad and Tobago.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kieron Pollard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kieron</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pollard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cricket Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1987</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tacarigua</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Trinidad And Tobago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hazel-Ann Pollard</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jenna Ali</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kaiden Pollard</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kieron Pollard ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
