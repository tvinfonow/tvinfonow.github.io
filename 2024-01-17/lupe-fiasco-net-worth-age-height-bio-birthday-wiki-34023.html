American singer and rapper who rose to fame through his album Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor.&nbsp;His single “Show Goes On”, charted at number 9 on the United States charts.</p><p>His first major break came when&nbsp;Jay Z&nbsp;signed him up to Atlantic Records.</p><p>Wasalu Muhammad Jaco (born February 16, 1982), better known by his stage name Lupe Fiasco (/ˈ l uː p eɪ / LOO -pay), is an American rapper, record producer, entrepreneur, and activist. He rose to fame in 2006 following the success of his debut album, Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor. He also performs as the frontman of rock band Japanese Cartoon under his real name. As an entrepreneur, Fiasco is the chief executive officer of 1st and 15th Entertainment.</p><p>He began rapping his poems in the eighth grade, and upon hearing Nas’ 1996 album, It Was Written, began to pursue hip hop. While attending Thornton Township High School, Fiasco met gang member Bishop G. The two became friends due to their shared interest in music. Fiasco’s father allowed him and Bishop to make mixtapes in his basement, and the two gained notoriety at the school for their music. However, they were kicked off stage during their first performance because their eclectic musical style was not embraced by the hip hop community. Early in his career, he went by stage names Little Lu and Lu tha Underdog. Growing up, Fiasco was given the nickname “Lu”, the last part of his first name, by his mother. “Lupe” is an extension of this nickname, which he borrowed from a friend from high school. “Fiasco” is a reference to The Firm song “Firm Fiasco”; the rapper “liked the way it looked on paper.” He also said of his name, “You know how rappers always have names like MC Terrorist—like they’re ‘terrorizing’ other rappers? I knew fiasco meant a great disaster or something like that, but I didn’t realize that the person named Fiasco would be the disaster, and that you should be calling other MCs fiascos—not yourself…it kind of humbled me in a sense. It taught me like, ‘Yo, stop rushing, or you’re going to have some fiascos.'”</p><p align=justify>He was the ninth child in a nine-child family.&nbsp;Shirley, his mother, was a chef.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lupe Fiasco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lupe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Fiasco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1982</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gregory Jaco, Shirley Jaco</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lupe Fiasco ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The title of the album is a reference to ‘Food and Liquor’ stores common in Chicago. He explains, “The store is where everything is at…Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. You need it to live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. I can see why it’s prohibited in Islam…I’ve always felt like liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both.” Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, among others.

Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with it, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in-house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos were two of the most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: “It was just such a ‘this isn’t right for you right now. This isn’t gonna work for you right now. You need to be focused on you. Do you really want that, do you really have the capacity to do it?'” In March 2013 Fiasco took to Twitter to announce that he had become the Creative Director at Higi, a scoring system based in the Chicago area that helps you to discover more about yourself so you can look, live and feel better.</p><p align=justify>In 2007, Fiasco announced his second album, Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool, a concept album that expands on the story of the track of the same name on his first album. While recording this album, Fiasco’s father died of type II diabetes and his business partner, Charles “Chilly” Patton, was convicted of attempting to supply heroin to a drug ring and was eventually sentenced to 44 years in a correctional facility. These events greatly affected Fiasco and the subsequent themes discussed on the record. The disc was released in December 2007 in United States while the first single and video from the album, “Superstar” featuring Matthew Santos was released the first week of November 2007. Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool, a concept album that expanded upon recurring themes in Food & Liquor, is about “a hustler who dies and comes back to life, only to get robbed by two little kids with the same gun that killed him.” For the record, Fiasco decided not to work with well-known producers as he considered it to be “too expensive”, noting the commercial failure of his Pharrell collaboration, “I Gotcha”.</p><h2>Who is Lupe Fiasco Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lupe Fiasco</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

With this remix, Fiasco wished to raise awareness of the conflict diamond business. This caught West’s attention, and he asked Fiasco to perform on the song “Touch the Sky” for West’s album Late Registration. The song, which sampled Curtis Mayfield’s “Move On Up”, became a hit in the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number forty-two. After this success, Fiasco’s first single “Kick, Push” was released earlier than expected. The song was a love story about two people sharing a passion for skateboarding, a topic generally not discussed in hip-hop. Fiasco explained, “[Skateboarding culture is] just as deep as hip-hop. I’m not the greatest skateboarder, but I’m a damn good rapper, so I made a damn good skateboarding song.” The single, and its accompanying music video, helped Fiasco get attention in the hip-hop community, and was later nominated for two 2007 Grammy Awards. During this time, he recorded guest performances on Tha’ Rayne’s “Kiss Me” and “Didn’t You Know” singles, and also on K Foxx’s 2004 “This Life”.</p><h3>What did Lupe Fiasco do?</h3><table><tr>Lupe Fiasco</tr><tr><td>Website</td><td>lupefiasco.com</td></tr></table><h3>What happened to the rapper Lupe Fiasco?</h3><p>Lupe Fiasco has cancelled his album and quit music after being accused of antisemitism.</p><h3>Is Lupe Fiasco a martial artist?</h3><p>During a 2008 interview with methodshop, Lupe Fiasco revealed that he has “<b>a black belt in karate</b>, two black belts in the styles of samurai sword fighting, kendo and aido” as well as “the equivalent of a black belt in Chinese wushu.”</p><h3>Has Lupe Fiasco gone platinum?</h3><p>His second album, Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool was his first album to be given an RIAA certification, being certified Gold.
