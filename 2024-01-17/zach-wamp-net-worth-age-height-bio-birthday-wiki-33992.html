However, shortly after winning reelection to a sixth term in 2004, Wamp announced he would run again in 2006 after all, citing his status as Tennessee’s only member of the powerful Appropriations Committee. The pledge was “a mistake,” he told the Associated Press in 2004.</p><p>When Lloyd did not run for re-election in 1994, Wamp ran again. Battling through a hotly contested primary, he easily defeated his childhood friend and sitting State Representative Kenneth J. Meyer by nearly two to one.

He proposed a plan to pay congressmen the same as Lieutenant Colonels and linked his Democratic opponent, Randy Button, to Bill Clinton. Wamp won the general election with 52% of the vote, during the Republican Revolution. He likely got coattails from Bill Frist and Fred Thompsons strong 1994 statewide elections, and was helped in 1996 by Lloyd crossing party lines to endorse him. After his first two elections, he never faced another close contest, and was reelected seven times. From 1998 onward, he won by 64 percent or more of the vote. Wamp explored seeking a seat in the United States Senate to succeed Bill Frist, who had promised to serve no more than two terms. He decided against running for that seat in October 2004.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Zach Wamp height</b> Not available right now.
