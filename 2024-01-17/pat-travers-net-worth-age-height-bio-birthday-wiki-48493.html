Who is Pat Travers dating now & how much money does Pat Travers have?</p><h2>Pat Travers Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Pat Travers</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>April 12, 1954</strong> in Toronto, <strong>Canada</strong>. Patrick Henry Travers (born April 12 1954) is a Canadian musician, keyboardist and vocalist who started his career as a recording artist in the late 1970s.</p><p>The second portion of the 80s were extremely exhausting for Travers.&nbsp;He had entered the decade as a top performer of the industry Travers was left in 1986 without a contract and was forced to work performing in nightclubs and traveling continuously.&nbsp;In 1990, he signed a contract with a tiny European label and was able to release School of Hard Knocks.&nbsp;The album was never heard by the radio.&nbsp;A full-length concert film Boom Boom – Live at the Diamond Club 1990 was filmed at Toronto which was to release in the form of CD Boom Boom next year however, Travers could not to replicate the success his previous decade and was only working on independent labels like Lemon Recordings.</p><p>This release also featured more mainstream music rather than the hard-driving rock Travers had recorded earlier, and included the hit single “I La La La Love You”, featured prominently on mainstream Top 40 and album oriented rock stations, and in the 1983 movie Valley Girl. Hot Shot was Travers’ last major label release of original music, and was a return to a harder-edge style of rock than his previous two albums had been. One of Travers’ best-recorded projects, it went basically unnoticed and is best remembered for the single “Killer”. It was during this time that Travers also released Just Another Killer Day, a 30-minute home video featuring music from Hot Shot that was a sci-fi type short story about sexy alien women searching for information on music here on earth. In 1984, Travers was again supporting Rush. Alex Lifeson is one of Travers’ many admirers.</p><p>Before the release of Hot Shot, longtime bassist Cowling left the band, and Travers would work with several different bassists including Cliff Jordan and Donni Hughes until Cowling’s return in 1989. Also at this time Jerry Riggs joined the Pat Travers Band, and he and Travers created a guitar team that fans considered difficult to rival. After Hot Shot’s release in 1984, Polydor made plans to issue a greatest hits package, and then ended their relationship with Travers.</p><p align=justify>In the year 1977 Travers also added another guitarist in his group, changing drummers two times, including Clive Edwards, and by the time Heat in the Street was released in 1978, the band had formed The Pat Travers Band.&nbsp;The group consisted of Travers singing and guitar, Pat Thrall on guitar, Cowling on bass, and Tommy Aldridge on drums and percussion.&nbsp;The band was heavily touring as well as supporting Rush in the Drive til You Die tour to promote A Farewell to Kings.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pat Travers</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pat</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Travers</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Toronto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Pat Travers ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
