New York Giants linebacker known as “LT” who is considered by many to be the greatest linebacker ever. He was a 2-time Super Bowl Champion, 10-time Pro Bowl selection, and the 1986 NFL Most Valuable Player. He retired with 132.5 career sacks and 1,088 tackles.</p><p>He and fellow Pro Football Hall of Famer <a href=#>Phil Simms</a> formed the backbone of the Giants in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p><p>After graduating from Lafayette High School in 1977, Taylor attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a team captain, and wore No. 98. Originally recruited as a defensive lineman, Taylor switched to linebacker before the 1979 season. He had 16 sacks in his final year there (1980), and set numerous defensive records. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in 1980. While there the coaching staff marveled at his intense, reckless style of play. “As a freshman playing on special teams, he’d jump a good six or seven feet in the air to block a punt, then land on the back of his neck”, said North Carolina assistant coach Bobby Cale. “He was reckless, just reckless.” UNC later retired Taylor’s jersey.</p><p>After an All-American career at the University of North Carolina (UNC) (1978–1981), Taylor was drafted by the Giants as the second overall selection in the 1981 NFL Draft. Although controversy surrounded the selection due to Taylor’s contract demands, the two sides quickly resolved the issue. Taylor won several defensive awards after his rookie season. Taylor is both the first and currently only NFL player to win the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in his rookie season. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Taylor was a disruptive force at outside linebacker, and is credited with changing defensive game plans, defensive pass rushing schemes, offensive line blocking schemes, and offensive formations used in the NFL. Taylor produced double-digit sacks each season from 1984 through 1990, including a career-high of 20.5 in 1986. He also won a record three AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) for his performance during the 1986 season. Taylor is one of only two defensive players in the history of the NFL to have ever won the NFL MVP award (the other one being Alan Page in 1971) and no defensive player has won since him. He was named First-team All-Pro in nine of his first ten seasons. Taylor was a key member of the Giants’ defense, nicknamed “The Big Blue Wrecking Crew”, that led New York to victories in Super Bowls XXI and XXV. During the 1980s, Taylor, fellow linebackers Carl Banks, Gary Reasons, Brad Van Pelt, Brian Kelley, Pepper Johnson, and Hall of Famer Harry Carson gave the Giants linebacking corps a reputation as one of the best in the NFL.</p><p align=justify>His first son, Brandon, was born in 1991. He was married to Deborah Belinda Taylor from 1981 to 1996 and Maritza Cruz from 2001 to 2005. He married his third wife Lynette Taylor in 2007.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawrence Taylor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawrence</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taylor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Willamsburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lynette Taylor , Maritza Cruz , Deborah Belinda Taylor</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lawrence Taylor ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

After six years, he had been named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award (1981), NFL Defensive Player of the Year a record three times (1981, 1982, 1986), First-team All-Pro six times, become the first defensive player in NFL history unanimously voted the league’s MVP (1986), and led his team to a championship (1986). After the win, however, Taylor felt let down rather than elated. Taylor said:</p><h2>Lawrence Taylor Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Lawrence Taylor is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States.

Taylor played his entire professional career as a linebacker for the New York Giants (1981–1993) in the National Football League (NFL). He is considered one of the greatest players in the history of American football, and has been ranked as the greatest defensive player in league history by former players, coaches, media members, and news outlets such as the NFL Network and Sporting News.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$200 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Taylor made his NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from incurring a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when he was supposed to drop into coverage. When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded “Well, we better put it in on Monday, because that play’s a dandy.” He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season is considered one of the best in NFL history. He was named 1981’s NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, making him as of 2018 the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor’s arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team’s best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team’s trainer he would be surprised if the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor’s life for $2 million.</p><p>Taylor’s talent was evident from the start of training camp. Reports came out of the Giants training compound of the exploits of the new phenom. Taylor’s teammates took to calling him Superman and joked that his locker should be replaced with a phone booth. Phil Simms, the team’s quarterback, said, “on the pass rush, he’s an animal. He’s either going to run around you or over you. With his quickness, he’s full speed after two steps.” Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants’ 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after facing him in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, “[h]e dang-near killed me, I just kept saying, ‘Who is this guy?’ He kept coming from my blind side and just ripped my ribs to pieces.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Lawrence Taylor height</b> <strong>6 ft 3 in</strong> Lawrence <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Taylor began using illicit drugs during his professional rookie season, 1981–1982.

In a poll of NFL General Managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league’s 28 GMs said if they had the first selection they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: “Taylor is the best college linebacker I’ve ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There’s no doubt in my mind about Taylor. He’s bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the blitz, he’s devastating.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Lawrence Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Football Player</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Lawrence Taylor celebrates birthday on February 4 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Washington Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs developed the two tight end offense and the position of h-back to prevent Taylor from blitzing into the backfield unhindered. “We had to try in some way have a special game plan just for Lawrence Taylor. Now you didn’t do that very often in this league but I think he’s one person that we learned the lesson the hard way. We lost ball games.” His skills changed the way offensive coaches blocked linebackers. In the late ’70s and early ’80s, a blitzing linebacker was picked up by a running back. However, these players were no match for Taylor. The tactic employed by San Francisco 49ers head coach Bill Walsh in the 1982 playoffs, using an offensive guard to block Taylor, was copied around the league. However, this left a hole in pass protection that a blitzing middle linebacker could exploit. Later, Walsh and other coaches began using offensive tackles to block Taylor. Later it became common for offensive linemen to pick up blitzing linebackers. In addition to the changes in offensive schemes Taylor influenced, he also introduced new defensive techniques to the game such as chopping the ball out of the quarterback’s hands rather than tackling him.</p><h3>What ended Lawrence Taylor's career?</h3><p>Taylor had originally failed a drug test for cocaine in 1987, but the NFL didn’t reveal this information, as was policy, until he failed his second test the following year.
