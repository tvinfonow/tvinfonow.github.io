He was a bronze medalist in the 1990 Goodwill Games in the 81&nbsp;kg division, being knocked out cold with a right cross thrown by the Soviet Andrey Kurnyavka in the quarterfinals after a three-round slugfest (Kurnyavka later told that this was the toughest of his 350 fights.)

Williams relocated to Catskill, New York. Instantly Williams made an impact on the American public. He won his first five fights by KO. While on the rise as a young pro, Williams defeated another undefeated prospect out of Detroit’s Kronk Gym, Danell Nicholson. Going into the fight many writers believed that Nicholson (who was managed and trained by Emmanuel Stewert) would pick apart the smaller Williams. Williams ripped Nicholson up in the first round and finished him in the 2nd round. Williams resembled a new age Jack Dempsey. A ferocious puncher who was of mixed blood.(Irish & African American; Dempsey Irish & Cherokee)He racked up a record of 15-0,12kos before his first loss, via majority decision to Larry Donald. After the loss to Donald, Williams reeled off another streak of knockouts, and wound up facing Henry Akinwande for the WBO Heavyweight Title. Williams would lose by KO in the 3rd round. Akinwande was much too big for Williams. It would appear, in retrospect, that Williams manager and father, Charlie, pushed Jeremy into the heavyweight division too soon and Akinwande capitalized on the much smaller and outclassed Williams. It is thought that this premature push into the heavyweight division (with Williams taking the fight on short notice) resulted in squashing Williams’s dreams for ever claiming a heavyweight title. He then began a new streak of KO victories but in fighting for the lightly regarded IBC heavyweight crown Williams lost by TKO to Denmark’s Brian Nielsen. There was some controversy surrounding the fight after Williams suffered from food poisoning after dining with the promoter the night before the bout. Some insiders have said that Williams was purposely poisoned. After another streak of knockouts he again was defeated this time by decision by perennial spoiler Maurice Harris. In 2003 he upset heavyweight prospect Andre Purlette by decision. Williams also competed Cedric Kushner’s Thunderbox Heavyweight Tournament, “Fistful of Dollars”, but lost on a 3-round decision that doesn’t count on his record.</p><h2>Who is Jeremy Williams Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jeremy Williams</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
