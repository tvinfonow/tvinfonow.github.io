Long-time English prisoner convicted for such crimes as armed robbery, death threats and wounding with intent. His violence and unpredictable habits while behind bars led to him being constantly moved from one prison to the next while the lengths of his sentences increased.</p><p>A 2008 film named Bronson was made about his life, with <a href=#>Tom Hardy</a> portraying him.</p><p>Born Michael Gordon Peterson in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was one of three sons of Eira and Joe Peterson. His father later ran the Conservative club in Aberystwyth. His uncle and aunt each served as mayor of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s. His aunt, Eileen Parry, is quoted as saying: “As a boy, he was a lovely lad. He was obviously bright and always good with children. He was gentle and mild-mannered, never a bully; he would defend the weak”.</p><p>He met Irene Kelsey in 1971, when he was still called Michael Peterson. Kelsey said that he “was so different from any other boys I knew. He always wore tailored suits, had perfectly-groomed sideburns and a Cockney accent.” Eight months later in 1972, when Kelsey was four months pregnant, the couple married at Chester Register Office. Their son is Michael Jonathan Peterson. Five years later they divorced, and Kelsey later remarried.</p><p align=justify>He was born Michael Gordon Peterson and raised with two brothers by Eira and Joe Peterson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charles Bronson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bronson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Eira Peterson, Joe Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mark Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Fatema Saira Rehman , Irene Kelsey</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Jonathan Peterson</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Charles Bronson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

During 1975 to 1977, he was switched between Armley, Wakefield, Parkhurst, and Walton prisons; he was taken from Yorkshire to London chained to the floor of a prison van. Kept in solitary confinement, he began a fitness programme. He continued to attack other convicts and damage prison property.

He was moved to Parkhurst Prison in 1976, where he befriended the Kray twins, whom he described as “the best two guys I’ve ever met”. He was moved back to Wandsworth after threatening to kill a prison officer. He spent four months in isolation after he was caught trying to dig his way out of his cell. After being returned to the prison’s general population, he caught up with the prisoner who had informed on his escape plan, and attacked him, scarring him for life.

There he attacked a prisoner with a jam jar, and was again charged with grievous bodily harm. He attempted suicide and attacked another prison officer, and was made subject to a transfer direction order under the Mental Health Act.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Charles Bronson height</b> <strong>5′ 9″</strong> Charles <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5′ 9″</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Bronson was convicted of armed robbery in 1974, aged twenty-two, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.
