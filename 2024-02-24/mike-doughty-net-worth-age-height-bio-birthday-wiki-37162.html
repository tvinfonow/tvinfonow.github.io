Alternative and indie rock musician, best known for his songs Looking at the World From the Bottom of a Well and the group Soul Coughing.</p><p>While at the New School University, he was a classmate of&nbsp;Ani diFranco.</p><p>While a doorman at the New York club The Knitting Factory (in that era, a hotbed of avant-garde jazz), Doughty founded Soul Coughing. The band released three critically and commercially successful albums, Ruby Vroom (1994), Irresistible Bliss (1996) and El Oso (1998). The greatest hits album Lust in Phaze was released in 2002.</p><p>Doughty broke up Soul Coughing in 2000 due to personal problems: He was wearying of the band, and he was addicted to opiate painkillers, heroin, and alcohol. He was promptly dropped by Warner Brothers, and began traveling in a rental car (covering 9,000 miles on his first tour) playing acoustic shows. After shows he would sit at the front of the stage and sell copies of his acoustic album Skittish — then on CD-Rs in plain white sleeves. Warner Brothers had rejected the record in 1996. During his three-year tour, Doughty sold 20,000 copies of Skittish and gradually developed a following independent of Soul Coughing. Doughty collaborated with BT on “Never Gonna Come Back Down” providing lyrics and vocals. “Never Gonna Come Back Down” was contained on BT’s album “Movements in Still Life” and released in 1999.</p><p align=justify>His father was an officer in the army and he was born to a military family.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Doughty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doughty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kentucky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Doughty ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

When Matthews professed to be a fan of Doughty’s solo record Rockity Roll and the song “27 Jennifers”, Doughty gave him a CD with rough mixes of an album he had been working on in Minneapolis with singer-songwriter and producer Dan Wilson. Matthews eventually released the album on his ATO label as Haughty Melodic (an anagram for ‘Michael Doughty’.) Haughty Melodic’ s singles “Looking at the World from the Bottom of a Well” and “I Hear the Bells” were each featured on episodes of Grey’s Anatomy and Veronica Mars, and Doughty appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, marking a return to the musical mainstream. He has since released a number of follow-up albums. Some of Doughty’s more recent albums, including Circles, Super Bon Bon and The Very Best of Soul Coughing, Live at Ken’s, and Stellar Motel, have used crowdfunding to finance their creation. He has also used Patreon to release a song every week for those paying $5 a month.</p><h2>Who is Mike Doughty Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mike Doughty</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
