Hall of Fame New York Knicks center who scored more than 22,000 points over the course of his career. He was also selected to eleven NBA All-Star teams over the duration of his 16-year NBA career.</p><p>The coach was assistant for the Orlando Magic when they acquired All-Star center&nbsp;He was an assistant coach with the Orlando Magic when they acquired All-Star center <a href=#>Dwight Howard</a>..</p><p>Patrick Aloysius Ewing (born August 5, 1962) is a Jamaican-American basketball coach and former professional player who is the head coach of the Georgetown University men’s basketball team. He played most of his career as the starting center of the NBA’s New York Knicks and also played briefly with the Seattle SuperSonics and Orlando Magic.</p><p>As a freshman during the 1981–82 season, Ewing became one of the first college players to start and star on the varsity team as a freshman. That year, Ewing led the Hoyas to their second Big East Tournament title in school history and a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. In the tournament, the Hoyas advanced to their first Final Four since 1943, where they defeated the University of Louisville 50–46, to set up a showdown in the NCAA Final against North Carolina. In one of the most star-studded championship games in NCAA history, Ewing was called for goaltending five times in the first half (later revealed to be intentional at the behest of coach John Thompson), setting the tone for the Hoyas and making his presence felt. The Hoyas led late in the game, but a shot by future NBA superstar Michael Jordan gave North Carolina the lead. Georgetown still had a chance at winning the game in the final seconds, but Freddy Brown mistakenly threw a bad pass directly to opposing player James Worthy.</p><p align=justify>He was married Rita Williams in 1990 and they had three children before getting divorced in 1998.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Patrick Ewing</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Patrick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ewing</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kingston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kingston Parish</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rita Williams-Ewing</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Patrick Ewing Jr., Randi Ewing, Corey Ewing</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Patrick Ewing ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Also, he was named the Big East Player of the Year. The Hoyas ultimately advanced to the Final Four for the third time in school history (and second time with Ewing) to face Kentucky, a team which had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the “Twin Towers”, Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Georgetown was able to turn an early 12 point deficit into a 53–40 win to advance to the National Championship game. In the final, the Hoyas faced the University of Houston, led by future Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon. Ewing and Georgetown prevailed with an 84–75 victory, giving the school its first and only NCAA Championship in school history.

An early-season showdown with #1 ranked Virginia and their star center Ralph Sampson was dubbed the “Game of the Decade”. Virginia’s veteran team won, 68–63, but Ewing at one point slam-dunked right over Sampson, a play which established Ewing as a dominating “big man”. The Hoyas posted a 22–10 record for the season and made another NCAA Tournament appearance, but Georgetown was defeated in the second round of the tournament by Memphis State. This would be the only season in Ewing’s Georgetown career where they did not make it at least as far as the National Championship game.</p><p align=justify>Beginning with the 1985 draft, the NBA handled matters differently. Every team that qualified for the playoffs received positions based on their winning percentage, and the teams that did not were placed in a lottery. In the first lottery, the NBA did not determine the positions as they do now. In this case, the seven teams that did not qualify for the playoffs were each given an equal chance to get the top pick. Each team had its name and logo put in an envelope, and the envelopes were placed into a hopper and spun to shuffle them. Once done, Commissioner David Stern then drew an envelope from inside to determine who would pick first. In a move that would create controversy for years to come, the envelope Stern drew was the one belonging to the New York Knicks. They drafted Ewing, as expected, beginning a 15-year relationship. They then signed him to a 10-year, $32 million contract, a contract which The New York Times years later described as “a tremendous contract at that time or any time.”</p><h2>Who is Patrick Ewing Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Patrick Ewing</strong> married to <strong>Rita Williams-Ewing </strong>.

Ewing was again named the Big East Player of the Year and the team won the Big East tournament title yet again. They entered the NCAA tournament as the #1 overall seed of the East Region, where they wound up advancing to another Final Four, their third in four years. In the National Semifinal game, Georgetown faced their Big East rivals, St. John’s and Chris Mullin, the fourth meeting between the schools that year. The Hoyas easily defeated the Redmen 77–59, setting up a matchup with another Big East rival in unranked Villanova for the title. An overwhelming favorite going into the game, Georgetown was upset by the Wildcats 66–64, who shot a record 78.6 percent (22 of 28) from the floor, denying Ewing and Georgetown back-to-back titles. At the conclusion of the season, Ewing was awarded the Naismith Player of the Year Award and the Associated Press Player of the Year.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Patrick Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Basketball Player</strong>.

Patrick Ewing celebrates birthday on August 5 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Ewing was expected to be the top pick in the 1985 NBA draft. The team that selected him would be making history by doing so. From 1966 until 1984, the NBA draft was conducted similarly to the NFL draft, where teams are awarded draft positions based on winning percentage. The difference was that instead of the team with the lowest percentage automatically being awarded the top pick, the NBA held a coin toss between the teams with the worst records in each conference and the winner of the coin toss selected first with the loser automatically picking second. This practice tended to encourage teams to purposely lose games in order to improve their draft position and potentially get into the coin toss. The only way two teams from the same conference could have the first two picks would have been if one of the two aforementioned teams traded their pick to another team (as the Indiana Pacers had done with what eventually became the number-two pick in the previous year’s draft).</p><h3>Is Patrick Ewings number retired?</h3><p>Ewing played 1,039 games for the Knicks. <b>On February 28, 2003, his jersey number 33 was retired</b> by the team in a large ceremony at Madison Square Garden.</p><h3>How many teams did Patrick Ewing play for in the NBA?</h3><p>Patrick Ewing played for <b>the Knicks from 1985-86 to 1999-00, the SuperSonics in 2000-01 and the Magic in 2001-02</b>.
