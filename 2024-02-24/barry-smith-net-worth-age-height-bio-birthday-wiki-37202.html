Barry Smith (born June 4, 1952) is an academic working in the fields of ontology and biomedical informatics. Smith is the author of more than 600 scientific publications, including 15 authored or edited books.</p><p>From the beginning of his career Smith has worked in the field of ontology, initially on the history of ontology as a sub-discipline of philosophy in the tradition of Brentano, Husserl, Ingarden and Reinach. A special focus was on the theory of ontological dependence and part-whole relations proposed by Husserl and applied by his students for example to the understanding of the ontology of mental and linguistic acts. In 1984 he published together with Mulligan and Simons the paper “Truth-Makers”. This paper helped to launch truthmaker theory, a still active research program at the borderlines of logic, semantics and philosophical ontology, based on a new understanding of the correspondence theory of truth.</p><p>From 1992 to 2016 Smith served as editor of The Monist: An International Quarterly Journal of General Philosophical Inquiry.</p><p>Since 2000 his research has been centered on the application of ontology in biomedical informatics, where he has worked on a variety of projects relating to biomedical terminologies and electronic health records. He is a founding Coordinating Editor of the OBO Foundry and has served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Gene Ontology Consortium, and of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). He contributes to the development of a number of biological and biomedical ontologies, including the Protein Ontology, the Plant Ontology, and others. Between 2005 and 2015 he was a co-PI of the NIH National Center for Biomedical Ontology and between 2013 and 2018 he served as ontology lead on the NIAID ImmPort project.</p><p align=justify>Among the cohort of graduate students supervised by Mays in Manchester were Kevin Mulligan (Geneva/Lugano), and Peter Simons (Trinity College, Dublin), who shared with Smith an interest in analytic metaphysics and in the contributions of certain turn-of-the-century Continental philosophers and logicians to central issues of analytic philosophy. In 1979 Mulligan, Simons and Smith together founded the Seminar for Austro-German Philosophy, which organized workshops and conferences centered around the work of early Central European philosophers from Bolzano to Tarski and their impact on contemporary philosophy.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry Smith</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Barry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bioinformatician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bury</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bury</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Barry Smith ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Since 2010 he was worked on a series of initiatives sponsored by the US Army Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) to create a framework for semantic enhancement of intelligence data in the Cloud. Since 2014 he is collaborator on initiatives of the US Air Force Research Laboratory on planning, mission assurance, and lifecycle management.
