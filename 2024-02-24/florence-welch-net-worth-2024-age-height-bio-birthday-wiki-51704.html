English Indie singer who is most well-known by her stage name as the lead singer of rock group Florence + the Machine.&nbsp;The group is famous for its singles like “Dog Days are Over” and “Drumming Song.”</p><p>She collaborated together with&nbsp;Calvin Harris&nbsp;on the track “Spectrum.”</p><p>Florence Leontine Mary Welch (born 28 August 1986) is an English-American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, poet, dancer, author, fashion icon, and artist. She is the vocalist and primary songwriter of the indie rock band Florence and the Machine. Florence and the Machine’s debut album, Lungs, was released in 2009; on 17 January 2010, the album reached the top position in the UK after being on the chart for 28 consecutive weeks.

The band’s fourth album High As Hope was released in 2018.</p><p>According to Welch, the band name “Florence + the Machine” had “started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine, to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn’t have a name, so I thought ‘Okay, I’ll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine’, before realising that name was so long it’d drive me mad”. In 2006, Welch’s performances with Isabella Summers in small London venues under the joint name Florence Robot/Isa Machine began to attract notice. In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label.
