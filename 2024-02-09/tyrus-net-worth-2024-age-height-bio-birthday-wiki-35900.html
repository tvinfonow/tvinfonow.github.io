Who is Tyrus dating now & how much money does Tyrus have?</p><h2>Tyrus Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Tyrus</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Actor</strong> who was born on <strong>February 21, 1973</strong> in Boston, Massachusetts, <strong>United States</strong>. George Murdoch (born February 21, 1973) is an American actor, cable television political commentator, and professional wrestler. He is known for his tenure in WWE as Brodus Clay, and in Total Nonstop Action as Tyrus.</p><p>In June 2007, Murdoch made his debut at FCW’s inaugural show on June 26, using the name G-Rilla and defeating Shawn Osborne. Three months later, on September 15, G-Rilla won a battle royal to become the number one contender to the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship by last eliminating Teddy Hart. He challenged Harry Smith for the championship on September 25, but lost via disqualification which meant that Smith retained the championship. The following month, G-Rilla continued to feud with Smith and Hart, who had formed The Hart Dynasty with TJ Wilson and Ted DiBiase, Jr., allying himself with Osborne, Jake Hager and Afa, Jr. G-Rilla briefly formed a tag team with Robert Anthony in December 2007, but on February 4, 2008, Murdoch was released from his contract with WWE.</p><p>In January 2010, Murdoch re-signed with WWE and was assigned to FCW. In March, Murdoch, once again using the name G-Rilla, formed an alliance with The Uso Brothers, Tamina, and Donny Marlow. He went on to defeat both Jacob Novak and Rudy Parker, before changing his ring name to Brodus Clay, a play on Snoop Dogg’s real name (Calvin Cordozar Broadus), in May 2010. On June 16, Clay and Marlow challenged Los Aviadores (Hunico and Epico) for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful. That same month, Clay and Marlow began referring to themselves as the Colossal Connection. The Colossal Connection would unsuccessfully challenge Los Aviadores and Derrick Bateman and Johnny Curtis for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship over the following months. In October, Clay appeared at a WWE house show, where he lost to JTG.</p><p>After a three-month absence due to the filming of the movie No One Lives, Clay reappeared on the August 4, 2011 episode of Superstars, where he defeated Pat Silva. Over the next few weeks, Clay continued to squash various jobbers on Superstars. WWE ran vignettes promoting his return to television on the November 7, 2011 episode of Raw. However, Clay’s television return was continuously delayed by authority figure John Laurinaitis to be “next week”, with this trend continuing all the way into January 2012. Clay made his television return on the January 9, 2012 episode of Raw as a face (heroic character) with a fun-loving, funk dancing gimmick, with the nickname “The Funkasaurus” and began using Ernest “The Cat” Miller’s theme song “Somebody Call My Momma”. Now accompanied by The Funkadactyls (Naomi and Cameron) and announced as hailing from “Planet Funk”, Clay incorporated gyrations and dance moves into his various squash wins on both Raw and SmackDown.</p><p align=justify>In early January 2007, G-Rilla feuded with Urban Assault, attacking the members during matches. He then formed a tag team with former enemy Freakin’ Deacon, with the pair defeating Urban Assault in their first match together. They went on to defeat teams including Frankie Coverdale and Bob Hoskins, the Samoan Fight Club of Siaki and Afa Jr., Shawn Osborne and Jon Bolen, and Robert Anthony and Johnny Curtis. In March, they faced and defeated the DSW Tag Team Champions, Team Elite (Mike Knox and Derrick Neikirk) in two successive non-title matches. However, in March 2007 Deacon was beaten up with steel chairs by Neikirk and Knox, the events of the night sent Deacon into a mental breakdown. The team dissolved shortly after.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tyrus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ueli</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gegenschatz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tyrus ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In November 2013, Clay started a storyline where he became angry and jealous of the debuting Xavier Woods, who “borrowed” Clay’s music and The Funkadactyls for his entrance. Clay thus began to exhibit more villainous tendencies, such as repeatedly attacking Woods, after he had defeated Woods in a match. At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Clay faced Woods’ partner, R-Truth and continually assaulted Truth instead of going for a win, so Tensai and the Funkadactyls left in protest and Clay lost the match.</p><h2>Tyrus Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tyrus is one of the <strong>richest Actor</strong> from United States.

By 1995, he was attending the University of Nebraska at Kearney, where he studied to become a teacher. He played college football during his school days. However, Murdoch has stated that his football career ended when surgery to remove a ruptured appendix severed nerve endings in his leg, leaving him with a permanent limp.</p><p align=justify>After signing a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Murdoch was assigned to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), a WWE developmental territory. He debuted in September 2006, and began using the ring name G-Rilla along with adopting the gimmick of a street thug. In his first match for the promotion, he defeated Big Bully Douglas in a dark match on September 7. The following month, G-Rilla became the enforcer for Urban Assault, a tag team composed of Eric Pérez and Sonny Siaki. However, he got in a feud with The Bag Lady, which cost Urban Assault a match for the DSW Tag Team Championship against The Major Brothers (Brian and Brett) on October 26. The group eventually won the championships from them on November 30, but the situation repeated on December 21, when G-Rilla started fighting with Bag Lady’s ally Freakin’ Deacon at ringside and it caused Urban Assault to lose to the Major Brothers. The same night, Deacon defeated G-Rilla in a singles match, after which Perez, Siaki, and new member Afa Jr. attacked G-Rilla, throwing him out of the group.</p><p align=justify>During the finale of season three of NXT, Clay was named part of the fourth season, with Ted DiBiase and Maryse as his Pros. He made his in-ring debut on NXT on the December 14, 2010 episode, teaming with DiBiase to defeat Byron Saxton and his mentor Chris Masters. Clay won a four-way elimination match on the January 25 episode of NXT, earning the right to choose a new Pro. He picked Alberto Del Rio as his new Pro, and then attacked DiBiase. The following week, Clay defeated DiBiase in a singles match; Del Rio “temporarily” passed Pro responsibilities of Clay to his manager Ricardo Rodriguez, but never returned for the rest of the season. In the season finale on March 1, Clay ended the competition in second place, losing to Curtis.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In January 2013, Clay competed in the 2013 Royal Rumble match and was eliminated by five men. Tensai was embarrassed after a dance contest, but Clay encouraged him to dance and have fun because “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas”. Tensai, with Clay’s encouragement, began using several “silly dance moves”. Two days later on WWE Main Event, Clay came out to support Tensai during his match with Titus O’Neil. Following this, Clay and Tensai formed a tag team and went on to defeat established teams such as Primo & Epico, Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal of 3MB and Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow). On the March 22 episode of SmackDown, Tensai and Clay were defeated by Team Rhodes Scholars after an interference from The Bella Twins. Tensai and Clay announced their official tag-team name “Tons of Funk” on the March 27 episode of Main Event, where they accompanied The Funkadactyls to ring in a losing effort to The Bella Twins. The two teams were originally booked to face each other in an eight-person mixed tag team match on April 7 at WrestleMania 29, but their match was cut due to time constraints. The match instead took place the following night on Raw, where Tons of Funk and The Funkadactyls emerged victorious.</p><p>On September 16, 2014, Murdoch debuted for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name Tyrus at TNA’s television tapings, aligning himself with Ethan Carter III (EC3).
