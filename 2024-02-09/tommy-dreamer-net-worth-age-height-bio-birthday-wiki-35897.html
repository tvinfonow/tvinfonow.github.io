During this time he held numerous championships including the ECW World Heavyweight Championship (which he held twice, being the only man to capture the title in both the original ECW and WWE’s ECW brand). He has also held the ECW World Tag Team Championship and WWF/E Hardcore Championship. Dubbed the “heart and soul” of ECW, Dreamer regularly featured in prominent storylines for the promotion as well as holding a number of back office roles.</p><p>Laughlin was trained in professional wrestling by Johnny Rodz. His first notable foray into the business came when he worked in International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW) under the name T.D. Madison. While there he and his storyline brother, G.Q., held the IWCCW Tag Team Championship three times in 1991. He changed his name to Tommy Dreamer, reportedly after taking his given first name, and adding “Dreamer” in tribute to Dusty Rhodes, in 1992 while working in the New England based Century Wrestling Alliance (CWA). While in the CWA, he became its first Heavyweight Champion by defeating “Mr. USA” Tony Atlas in a tournament final held in Wallingford, Connecticut on November 5, 1992.

The two were portrayed as childhood friends who had been competing in different ways their entire lives. Raven’s entrance into ECW had him accompanied by Beulah McGillicutty, an overweight girl from their kayfabe childhood who had a crush on Dreamer and was now a Penthouse Pet. Dreamer and Raven (and Raven’s Nest) feuded for two years with Dreamer never getting a win over Raven until Raven’s last match in ECW, a Loser Leaves Town match at Wrestlepalooza 1997. During the course of the feud, Beulah had left Raven and was Tommy’s valet.</p><h2>Tommy Dreamer Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tommy Dreamer is one of the <strong>richest Wrestler</strong> from United States.

The two had several encounters that ended with Dreamer being chokeslammed through tables. During other fights, the pair brawled outdoors onto the street and into traffic. The feud culminated in a scaffold match at the October 1996 High Incident event, where Dreamer sent Lee off the scaffolding through several tables in the ring below.</p><p>In 1998, Dreamer had a short feud with The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von), during which they “broke” Beulah’s neck. In 1999, on their last night in the company, they cited this incident to get Dreamer to accept a challenge for the ECW Tag Team Championship they had won earlier in the night. He did accept, and got the title, but was paired with the unexpected partner Raven, who slid into the ring at the last second and made the pin. The team only lasted a short time before it dissolved, with Raven taking the title and choosing Mike Awesome as his new partner. He also, begrudgingly, became World Heavyweight Champion in 2000 by beating Tazz at CyberSlam, only to lose it to Justin Credible just 30&nbsp;minutes later.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tommy Dreamer height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Tommy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Dreamer joined Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1993, just before its name change to Extreme Championship Wrestling. His first major gimmick in the company had him wrestling in matches in garish green suspenders and acting as something of a “pretty boy” – at least in relation to the rest of the ECW roster.
