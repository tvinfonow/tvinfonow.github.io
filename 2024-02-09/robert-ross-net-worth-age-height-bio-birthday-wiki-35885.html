He was born in 1950. His father was Colonel Walter John Macdonald Ross. He was Lord Lieutenant at Kirkcudbright between 1977 and 1982. His older brother was Lieutenant-Colonel Malcolm Ross, Comptroller for the Lord Chamberlain’s Office (from 1991 to 2006) and Lord Lieutenant at Kirkcudbright (2006 to 2018).</p><p>The Scottish Daily Mail has described Ross as the “trusted advisor” of Prince of Wales (who happens to be Duke of Cornwall).&nbsp;The Guardian described the Duchy in 2011 as a “target-oriented investment portfolio” headed by Bertie Ross, a PS200,000-a year chief executive. Ross oversees the equivalent to 91 full-time employees.&nbsp;Ross was challenged by members of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in 2005. They argued that the Duchy’s accounts should not be made public. Ross rebuffed their requests, saying that “The Duchy of Cornwall income belongs to the Prince of Wales.”&nbsp;Any private business or estate should have the right to its own audit.&nbsp;Others on the committee claimed that the PS11.9million the prince was earning through the duchy was excessive. Gerry Steinberg stated that Ross said the Prince used the money to pay his staff and expenses. This statement made headlines.&nbsp;Ross denied any wrongdoing.</p><p align=justify>Ross was made a Commander in the Royal Victorian Order during the 2006 New Year Honours and promoted to Knight Commander during the 2012 New Year Honours.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert Ross</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ross</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1981</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Houston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Walter John Macdonald Ross, Josephine May Cross</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Robert Ross ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
