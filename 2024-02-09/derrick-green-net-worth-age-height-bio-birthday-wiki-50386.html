Against was released in 1998 and the group set out on a world tour. Green moved from New York and decided to live in Amsterdam while on a promo tour.

In an interview, Derrick said about the album that “every song will be related to the idea of building this idea of a positive nation. We will have our own flag, our own anthem, our own army”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Derrick Green height</b> Not available right now.
