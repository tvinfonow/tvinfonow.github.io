After two short call-ups with the Padres, he finally got his chance at an everyday job after being traded to Cleveland after the 1989 season along with Carlos Baerga and Chris James, in exchange for power-hitter Joe Carter. Once in Cleveland, he established his reputation as a skilled defensive player by becoming the first rookie catcher to start an All-Star game and winning both Rookie of the Year honors and a Gold Glove Award. He became the third catcher in Major League history to win a Gold Glove Award in his rookie season, joining Johnny Bench and Carlton Fisk.</p><p>Alomar was selected as an All-Star in 1991 and 1992. However, his 1991 season was largely lost due to injuries, and he finished the year with zero home runs and only seven RBIs in 199 at-bats. Over the next few years, Alomar suffered several injuries and failed to realize his potential. He came back strong in the first half of 1996 to make his fourth All-Star team, but then faded in the second half.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=6><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sandy Alomar Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sandy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kemper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Salinas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sandy Alomar Sr., María Velázquez</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Roberto Alomar</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Margred Alomar , Kelly Donovan</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brianna Alomar, Marcus Alomar, Leanna Alomar, Isabella Alomar, Marisa Alomar</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sandy Alomar Jr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
