He is a professional wrestler who was well-known for his work in the ECW and independent circuits.

They engaged in a long feud with the Rock ‘N Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson). During their stint, the NAACP would picket outside the performance venues because of the “Gangsta” gimmick, claiming that no racial violence had occurred in the Tennessee area for years, and they did not want the reputation of gangsters to be put into the Tennessee area. After the feud with the Rock ‘n’ Roll Express ended, they feuded with The Thugs (Tracy Smothers and Tony Anthony) and with USWA’s PG-13 until they left the company in June 1995.</p><p align=justify>Jerome Young was his name.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jack</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jack</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Greensboro</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>North Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jennifer Young</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>New Jack ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The Gangstas were scheduled to face D-Von Dudley and Axl Rotten. Axl, however, never made it to the show for reasons never made clear. (In the 2005 documentary Forever Hardcore, New Jack said he thinks something happened with Axl’s grandmother, which forced Axl to not make it). Rotten was replaced with “Mass Transit” Eric Kulas, an untrained seventeen-year-old who convinced booker Paul Heyman that he was twenty-three and had been trained by the veteran Killer Kowalski. Kulas requested that New Jack “blade” him during the match, but the incision was made incorrectly, causing excessive bleeding. Kulas was hospitalized as a result, eventually receiving fifty stitches. New Jack was charged with aggravated assault stemming from the incident, but was acquitted. Kulas subsequently sued New Jack and ECW for damages in July 1998, but lost the case. Kulas died on May 12, 2002 at the age of 22 due to complications from gastric bypass surgery. Later, Kulas’ parents tried to sue New Jack because they believed their son’s death was caused due to depression and a major eating disorder after what New Jack did to him.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>New Jack height</b> Not available right now.
