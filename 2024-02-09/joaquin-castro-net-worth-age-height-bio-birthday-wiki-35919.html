Bruce Davidson predicted that Castro could have defeated the announced candidate, Beto O’Rourke, representative of Texas’s 16th congressional district based in El Paso, for the Democratic senatorial nomination. “Castro is said to be ambitious, but will he ever have a better chance to move up than in the Trump-era against Ted Cruz?,” Davidson asked. Davidson added that Texas’ other senator, Republican John Cornyn of San Antonio, would have taken advantage of a similar opportunity to run. In 2002, Cornyn, the state’s then one-term attorney general, filed to succeed retiring Republican Senator Phil Gramm, while two other Republican hopefuls, Henry Bonilla of Texas’s 23rd congressional district and David Dewhurst, the land commissioner and later the lieutenant governor, vacillated and lost their chance to become a senator. Bonilla was defeated for House re-election after redistricting in 2006, and Dewhurst subsequently lost the 2012 Republican runoff election for the Senate to Ted Cruz.</p><h2>Joaquin Castro Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Joaquin Castro is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States.
