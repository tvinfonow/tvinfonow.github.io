Who is Hunt Slonem dating now & how much money does Hunt Slonem have?</p><h2>Hunt Slonem Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Hunt Slonem</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Celebrity</strong> who was born on <strong>July 18, 1951</strong> in Kittery, Maine, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Hunt Slonem’s artistic career began in New York, in the late 1970s. When he first came to Manhattan, in 1973, he was hired by the Department of Social Services to teach painting to senior citizens. He was unhappy at his job and seriously considered moving to Amsterdam when, unexpectedly, in 1975, he got a call from artist Janet Fish who offered him her studio for the summer. That telephone call turned Slonem’s life around. Shortly afterwards, In 1976, Hunt Slonem received a painting grant from the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and began painting in earnest. His first solo show was held at New York’s Harold Reed Gallery in 1977, followed by a major exhibition at the prestigious Fischbach Gallery. As Slonem’s career progressed, he was introduced to people like Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli, Sylvia Miles, and Truman Capote. Through Jeffrey Slonim, who would later serve as an usher at Andy Warhol’s funeral, he also met and befriended the Belgian-born actress Monique van Vooren, the star of Warhol’s film Flesh for Frankenstein. He soon became a habitué of New York’s trendiest hot spots and an active participant in the city’s burgeoning art scene.</p><p>After completing school, which included living in Nicaragua as an exchange student when he was 16 years old, Slonem commenced undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He then spent about six months of his sophomore year at the University of the Americas in San Andrés Cholula, Puebla, Mexico, but later graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Painting and Art History from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. He also took courses at the reputable Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where he was exposed to such influential artists from the New York area as Louise Nevelson, Alex Katz, Alice Neel, Richard Estes, Jack Levine, and Al Held. During that period, Slonem altered the “i” to an “e” in his family name as a nod to numerology. He moved to New York in 1973 to further his art practice, and Manhattan had become his consistent base ever since.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hunt Slonem</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Iron</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steele</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Painter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kittery</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeffrey Slonim</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Hunt Slonem ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Hunt Slonem's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Hunt Slonem's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In the early 1980s, Slonem began working on a new series of so-called “Rabbit paintings.” The idea for this critically acclaimed series came to him after he had discovered that the year of his birth, 1951, was the year of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac calendar. He often repeats imagery in this series, just like in his other series, because, he told the Wall Street Journal, the act is similar to spiritual meditation: “Mantras are holy because you repeat them.” This theme continued to inspire Slonem over the years, and the series is as prominent in his work today as it was over thirty years ago.</p><h2>Hunt Slonem Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Hunt Slonem is one of the <strong>richest Painter</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Hunt Slonem</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Hunt Slonem (born Hunt Slonim, July 18, 1951) is an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker. He is best known for his Neo-Expressionist paintings of tropical birds, often based on a personal aviary in which he has been keeping from 30 to over 100 live birds of various species. Slonem’s works are included in many important museum collections all over the world; he is exhibiting regularly at both public and private venues, and he has received numerous honors and awards.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Celebrity</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Slonem’s obsessive and repetitive rendering of his subjects reflects his desire to explore issues of spatial complexity, compression and density in what the acclaimed Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler deemed “a consistent investigation of post-cubist abstraction.” The repetitive imagery also makes a reference to Andy Warhol. “I was influenced by Warhol’s repetition of soup cans and Marilyn,” says Slonem. “But I’m more interested in doing it in the sense of prayer, with repetition… It’s really a form of worship.” He is not interested in realism or, unlike Warhol, in advertising or media, and his paintings are neither narrative nor specific in detail. Rather, Slonem’s work is deeply rooted in the act of painting. His jarring color choices, spontaneous mark making, and scratched hatch marks are the result of his ongoing fascination with the manipulation and implementation of paint. For Slonem, cross-hatching has “a feeling of a tapestry, it’s like weaving. I’m making colors bleed into each other, I’m revealing the under-painting. I’m making these marks to allow the light to come through, basically. So you’re seeing about five levels of paint, instead of one.” It is this kind of devotion to the process of painting that prompted Henry Geldzahler to observe in 1993 that “Slonem is a painter, a painter’s painter with an enormous bag of technical tricks which become apparent to the viewer the longer he stands before the work.”</p><p>In 2008, German automaker Audi enlisted Hunt Slonem to create an exclusive design for its sleek new A5 coupe, and he created a one-of-a-kind design based on one of his oil painting for the car’s exterior. “It’s an earlier work of mine with birds flying through the sky; the original work is in the collection of the Colby Museum in Maine, where I was born,” said Slonem of the piece, which is painted in blues, blacks, reds, and whites with cockatoos. The mobile artwork was unveiled in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show at the Audi Forum in Manhattan. The “Hunt Slonem Audi A5,” as it was dubbed, then toured Audi dealerships throughout the United States, before returning to New York where it was auctioned off to benefit a cancer research charity.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Hunt Slonem height</b> Not available right now.

In 2010, Slonem moved to a 15,000 square foot fourth floor former headquarters of the film company Moviola, on West 45th Street. The space served as his painting studio and was divided into a number of small rooms, all of which Slonem painted in old Louisiana plantation-house colors. The studio housed his ever-expanding quirky collections, from Neo-Gothic chairs to top hats, to marble busts of Marie Antoinette, to various objets d’art, mined from flea markets and antique fairs. In an interview in Vincent Katz’s book Pleasure Palaces: The Art & Homes of Hunt Slonem, he describes his collecting technique as “cluttering.” For him, objects are “friends;” the more there are, the more he is inspired. “I have to have a certain amount of stuff in place before I can function and paint,” he says. Although, Slonem still lives in the loft apartment he moved into in 1973, according to the Wall Street Journal, he does nearly all his entertaining at his new 25,000 square foot West 34th Street studio in the industrial Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan where he moved in 2011. He christened the third floor loft space with a birthday party attended by more than 200 people.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Iron Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Celebrity</strong>.
