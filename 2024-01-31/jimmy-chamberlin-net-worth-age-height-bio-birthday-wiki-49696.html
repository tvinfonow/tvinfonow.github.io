During the recording of 1993’s Siamese Dream in Marietta, Georgia, Chamberlin often disappeared for days at a time into the drug underworld of Atlanta, while the rest of the band feared for his life. He later said of his drug addiction that “It’s pretty textbook […] Guy makes it in rock band, gets very full of himself, starts thinking he’s indestructible, and all of a sudden he destroys himself.”</p><p>Chamberlin left home at age 15 and joined a series of local bands. Although his early music career proved profitable, Chamberlin’s father pressured him into going to college. In 1994, Chamberlin revealed that he had been estranged from his father for seven years.

Life was scary for me.” Prior to shows scheduled July ’96 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health.
