Who is Paul Davis dating now & how much money does Paul Davis have?</p><h2>Paul Davis Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Paul Davis</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Association Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>December 9, 1961</strong> in London, London, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Paul Vincent Davis (born 9 December 1961) is an English former footballer. Davis was an integral part of the successful Arsenal side of the late 1980s, and early 1990s, winning the League Cup in 1987 and the First Division in 1989 and 1991. He also won the Cup-Double in 1993 and the Cup-Winners Cup 1994. Davis appeared in total 447 times for Arsenal, scoring 30 goals in the League and 7 goals in the cups.</p><p>On 17 September 1988, three days after being an unused substitute for England at Wembley against Denmark, Davis punched Southampton player Glenn Cockerill in the jaw, during a 2–2 draw at Highbury. Cockerill’s jaw was broken and following the FA’s analysis of TV footage Davis was given a then unprecedented 9-match ban and £3,000 fine to him. Davis only played 12 league games, scoring once in the 1988–89 title winning season. Davis also suffered a bad thigh injury that plagued him for 18 months. So he missed the climax of the season at Anfield.</p><p>Along with the signings of David Seaman and Anders Limpar, it was the rejuvenation of Davis during the 1990–91 season that led to Arsenal reclaiming the First Division title, absorbing only one defeat along the way. Davis missed only 1 League game of this season and won Football League XI recognition.</p><p>However, after a spell on loan with Swedish club IFK Eskilstuna in June/July 1990, he returned to play a regular role in the 1990–91 title triumph.</p><p align=justify>He was a veteran in terms of individual deeds done and his importance to the club, yet still only 25 and without a major winners medal to his name. Davis, blessed with a wonderful left foot, startling on-pitch vision and unerring pass accuracy, was renowned for his calmness within the heat of a midfield battle. Elegant yet not unwilling to use force when needed, he was the perfect multi-purpose midfielder. In George Graham’s first season in charge 1986–87, Davis had a great campaign. He formed a brilliant midfield partnership with Steve Williams, which was key to Arsenal beating Liverpool in the League Cup Final 2–1. Davis was in the side again in April 1988, bidding to retain the cup, but disappointingly lost 3–2 to Luton Town in the Final.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Davis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Paul Davis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
