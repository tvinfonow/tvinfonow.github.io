The film was a remake of the Japanese film Kairo (2001), and was adapted by Wes Craven and Ray Wright. Filming took place in Romania, a traumatic time for Milian, where she endured racial abuse and discovered that boyfriend Nick Cannon was cheating on her. Milian has also appeared in two video games: Def Jam Vendetta (2003), where she plays Angel, a mob boss’ girlfriend, and as one of the female leads, Carmen Mendez, in the video game Need for Speed: Undercover (2008).</p><p align=justify>She was with&nbsp;She dated <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a> from 2003 to 2005.

During this time, she had minor roles in film and television, including Sister, Sister, Smart Guy, The Steve Harvey Show, Get Real, The Wood and American Pie. In 2002, Milian was appointed the host of the live competitive music series Becoming Presents: Wannabe on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn. Kahn suggested she audition for a lead role in the film Torque. Her audition was successful and she played a minor role in the film. She was subsequently cast in her first lead role in Love Don’t Cost a Thing. Milian has been described as a role model to young girls; she has said that there are a lot of people who young girls look up to, but “at the end of the day you have to be your own person and love yourself.” Milian worked with the Children Uniting Nations charity, in which she was a big sister to foster children, and says her favorite charity is the Penny Lane Foundation. Milian was awarded with a humanitarian award at The Reign fundraiser from the Elton John AIDS Foundation for being a role model for young children. Milian said, “I’ve never been rewarded that way and never been acknowledged like that. That was really nice of them, and I was happy I was able to show up for the kids.”</p><h2>Christina Milian Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Christina Milian is one of the <strong>richest R&B Singer</strong> from United States.

Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, but raised in Maryland, Milian signed a contract with Murder Inc. Records at the age of 19. In 2001, Milian released her self-titled debut album, which featured the singles “AM to PM” and “When You Look at Me”; “AM to PM” charted within the Top 40 of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and both peaked in the top three on the UK Singles Chart. In 2004, Milian released her second studio album It’s About Time, which provided her first major U.S. hit, “Dip It Low”, which reached number five on the U.S. Billboard chart. “Whatever U Want” was released as the album’s second single. Both singles charted within the Top 10 of the UK chart.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The critical response to the album was mixed to generally positive. Imran Ahmed of the New Musical Express predicted that based on the record, “genius can’t be more than a few albums away”. Contrastingly, entertainment.ie writer Andrew Lynch suggested that Milian needed original ideas. Milian believed that the public expected “a certain thing” from her when she first appeared with Ja Rule, however she wanted to record the type of music she was signed to do. She said that “AM to PM” was a “cool record,” but it was not what the public expected. Milian approached the executives at her record company, Island Def Jam, and “cussed them all out”, telling them that they were not listening to her. She felt that she had gained their respect by explaining that she was serious about her musical career. In the following years, she was featured on the track “It’s All Gravy”, a duet with British rapper Romeo, which was a UK top ten hit; provided the theme song for the hit Disney Channel animated series Kim Possible, “Call Me, Beep Me!”; and collaborated with Hilary Duff on Duff’s Christmas album Santa Claus Lane (2002), on the song “I Heard Santa on the Radio”.</p><p>Milian felt that Island Def Jam was confused as to how they wanted her image to be portrayed; one second she was young and singing “AM to PM”, and next she was a grown woman singing “Get Away”. She realized that the change confused the audience, and that “nobody was buying it”. In 2003, Milian’s label Def Soul was shut down and absorbed by its parent Def Jam, although Milian was instead moved over to Island Records. After the international release of her debut album, Milian went back into the recording studio. The singer felt that music trends had changed into rock music, hardcore hip hop and tribute songs, and her music did not fall into those categories. Milian decided to stop recording and toured overseas for a year and a half. When she returned to the US, she decided not to release her previous album domestically, and started working on a new album. Milian traveled the world, working with the popular producers Bloodshy & Avant, “Darkchild”, Cory Rooney, Warryn Campbell, Bryan-Michael Cox and Polli Paul.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Christina Milian height</b> Not available right now.

The song was released as the album’s lead single in 2000, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, and in the top 30 of the UK Singles Chart. Milian co-wrote and performed backing vocals for the track “Play” for Jennifer Lopez’s album J. Lo (2001), and co-wrote “Same Ol’ Same Ol'”, the second single from girl group PYT’s debut album PYT (Down with Me) (2001). Milian’s collaboration with Ja Rule led to a record deal with Def Soul Records, prompted by his affiliation with Murder Inc. Records, an imprint that was distributed through Def Jam, the parent label of Def Soul Records. She travelled to Sweden and recorded her self-titled debut album. The album was released on October 9, 2001 in the UK, peaking at number 23 and selling a total of 101,986 copies. Internationally, the album peaked at number 36 in the Netherlands, and number 98 in Sweden. The album’s domestic release was postponed because of the September 11 attacks, which occurred just two weeks before its release date. Her label opted to release it later that year, in the fourth quarter, but as Milian explained, new artists generally do not release their albums during that time. As a result, the album was again delayed until the first quarter of 2002; however, Milian eventually opted not to release it. Two singles were taken from the album, “AM to PM” and “When You Look at Me”, both of which charted worldwide. A music video for the track “Get Away” was filmed in Paris, although it was not officially released as a single.</p><p align=justify>Milian’s second studio album, It’s About Time, was released in the US on July 13, 2004. The critical response to the album was mixed; the club tracks, most notably lead single “Dip It Low”, were praised while the ballads were said to be disappointing. The style and sound of the album was compared to that of Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez by several critics. Milian later admitted that her new sexy image for “Dip It Low” and the whole album was mainly for shock value. She had to make her way back into the US market, and by choosing a sexier image, she made a name for herself. “Dip It Low” was also meant to show that she was not the same 18-year-old girl in the “AM to PM” video. To create her new image, Milian also decided to change her appearance and lightened her hair. Taking inspiration from Janet Jackson who constantly changed her image, Milian thought to herself, “‘When did I like Janet Jackson the most?’ It was when she had her lightened hair.”</p><h2>Who is Christina Milian Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Christina Milian</strong> married to <strong>M.
