He was promoted to WWE’s Raw brand shortly afterwards in 2005, playing the caddy sidekick to Kerwin White. He was sent back to OVW shortly afterwards, being given the name Nicky and joining the cheerleading-themed Spirit Squad, who debuted on Raw in January 2006 and won the World Tag Team Championship once before returning to OVW that November. In September 2007, Nemeth was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice, with Brad Allen and later Gavin Spears.</p><h2>Dolph Ziggler Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Dolph Ziggler is one of the <strong>richest Wrestler</strong> from United States.

He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker’s entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event, Ziggler seemed to enter with his usual music and Titantron graphics, but the music was scratched off and the graphics turned off, and he simply entered with no music or Titantron (like a wrestler in the 1980s or prior). He was then defeated by Roode, who pinned him while holding his tights. Right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by pinfall while holding his tights, similar to how Roode defeated him. On the October 31 edition of SmackDown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot on Team SmackDown for the Survivor Series five-on-five elimination match against Raw after being defeated by Roode in a two-out-of-three falls match. Ziggler was involved in a verbal backstage confrontation with both Roode and United States Champion Baron Corbin on the December 5 episode of SmackDown, where Roode defeated Corbin via disqualification after being attacked by Ziggler. The following week, Roode interfered in a match between Ziggler and Corbin in similar fashion, resulting in a disqualification victory for Ziggler. At Clash of Champions, Ziggler defeated Corbin and Roode in a triple threat match to win his second United States Championship. On the following episode of SmackDown on December 19, Ziggler held a celebration that was a retrospective of his WWE career; he said that the fans did not deserve him and placed the title belt in the ring before leaving. A week later, general manager Daniel Bryan said that Ziggler was nowhere to be found and had indeed vacated his title, so that a tournament to crown a new champion would be held (which was won by Bobby Roode).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Nemeth was called up to the Raw roster shortly afterwards, making his television debut on the September 19, 2005, episode of Sunday Night Heat. He was made the enforcer and sidekick for Chavo Guerrero, Jr., who was using a golfer in-ring persona and going by the ring name of “Kerwin White”. As such, Nemeth became White’s caddy. His wrestling debut came on an episode of Sunday Night Heat, teaming up with White in a tag team match against Shelton Benjamin and Matt Striker. After the death of Eddie Guerrero, Chavo Guerrero dropped the “Kerwin White” character, and Nemeth no longer played the role of his caddy and tag partner. After a few months of wrestling in dark matches and at house shows, he was sent back to OVW.</p><p>Nemeth signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2004.

On the following episode of Raw, Sami Zayn defeated Rusev to challenge for the title; however, Ziggler defended his championship against Miz on the 900th episode of SmackDown, and was defeated after a distraction by Maryse, ending his reign at 37 days. On the November 22 edition of SmackDown, it was announced that Ziggler would face Miz in a Ladder match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders, & Chairs event for the Intercontinental Championship in what was advertised as their final match, where Ziggler was defeated. On the December 13 edition of SmackDown, Ziggler pinned Dean Ambrose in a fatal four-way elimination match also involving The Miz and Luke Harper, to become the number one contender to AJ Styles’ WWE Championship. The following week, Baron Corbin confronted Ziggler, and the two had a match with Ziggler’s number one contender’s spot on the line. The match ended in a double count-out and Daniel Bryan made the December 27 episode’s WWE Championship match a triple-threat between Styles, Ziggler, and Corbin. In that match, Styles retained the WWE Championship after pinning Ziggler.</p><p align=justify>During his time at St. Edward, the wrestling team won the National Championships on two occasions.
