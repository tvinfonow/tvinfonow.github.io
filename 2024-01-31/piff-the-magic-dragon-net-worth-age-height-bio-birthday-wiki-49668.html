John van der Put was born and is known as Piff the Magic Dragon. He is a comedian and magician whose routine includes deadpan humor.&nbsp;He acts with Mr. Piffles, a chihuahua dressed in a dragon costume.</p><p>He sold a magic trick of him to&nbsp;He sold a magic trick of his to <a href=#>David Blaine</a>..</p><p>Van der Put won the 2008 British Ring Close-up Magician of the Year, while The Magic Circle awarded him their 2011 Close-up Magician of the Year, 2012 Stage Magician of the Year (as Piff), and 2013 Carlton Award. In 2013, the Circle also inducted him into their Inner Ring with Gold Star.</p><p>In 2008, van der Put created his stage persona of Piff the Magic Dragon, dressing in a green, red and yellow dragon costume, with self-deprecating humour and deadpan delivery. He is assisted by “Mr. Piffles”, a chihuahua in a dragon costume. The Magic Dragon persona was created by happenstance, when he went to a costume party in a dragon outfit, and nobody else turned up in costume. “It was just me. And one of my friends who knew that I was a magician said to me, ‘You should do this in your act. You could be Puff the Magic Dragon.’ And I said, ‘Wait, I could be Piff the Magic Dragon. You might have heard of my older brother, Steve.’ And that’s where that came from.”</p><p align=justify>He was born in London and grew up in South East London.&nbsp;Later, he would move to Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Piff the Magic Dragon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Piff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Magic</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Magician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1980</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Piff the Magic Dragon ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In June 2019, van der Put was named one of Variety’s 10 Comics to Watch for 2019. Van der Put lives in Las Vegas and has a residency at The Flamingo.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Magician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With fellow alumni of the CSSD Alexis Terry, Maya Politaki, and Lucy Cullingford, he co-founded the theatrical cabaret company standnotamazed, becoming their artistic director. The company’s Love and Other Magic Tricks, starring Politaki and van der Put and described in a WhatsOnStage review as “a show of subtlety and magic rather than drama and showmanship”, won the Time Out Critic’s Choice award as well as the 2009 Buxton Festival Fringe’s award for Best Production, and was nominated for the Festival’s Best New Writing award. Van der Put also had a supporting role in Derek Walcott’s 2008 operatic production of Seamus Heaney’s The Burial at Thebes at Shakespeare’s Globe.</p><p>In 2011, Piff appeared on the first season of Penn & Teller: Fool Us with a phased transformation of incorrect card to signed card, a performance that according to Metro saw him “steal the show” with a routine that would “have been as welcome on a small stage at a comedy festival as it would a Vegas stage”. Although his card trick segment of the performance fooled Penn and Teller initially, the pair seemed to figure it out and were therefore “not fooled” by Piff’s own admission on stage. Penn subsequently revealed the method they gave on air was “kinda sorta wrong” and Piff just played along. The duo rated the act their favourite of the season, and Piff “a stunningly good magician”. The routine was subsequently voted onto Channel 5’s TV’s 50 Greatest Magic Tricks. The next year, his routine was plagiarised by a Ukrainian magician on the Russian TV3 show Surprise Me! (Russian: Удиви меня!) .</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Piff the Magic Dragon height</b> Not available right now.

And it was so funny, I went out the next day and I got Mr. Piffles. And, so I didn’t really think about it. And then you know, eventually I started seeing dinosaur costumes for dogs. So, we put him in a dinosaur costume. And then it was just really funny to me, when people are saying “So you’re a genuine magic dragon?” And I would say “Yes.” And then they’d say, “So, is the dog a dragon too?” I’d say “No, it’s just a dog in a dragon outfit.” Having that sort of play was funny to me.</p><p align=justify>Van der Put moved to Las Vegas to join The Cosmopolitan’s Rose.
