His one sibling, a sister, was born in 1974. McDonald’s stepfather was an alcoholic and abusive, and McDonald and his sister endured years of poverty and violence. This experience would be a theme portrayed in McDonald’s writing. In late primary school and early high school McDonald discovered rock music such as Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, and Sex Pistols. McDonald bought a guitar and began jamming with like-minded friends and found an outlet for the frustration he was experiencing in his unhappy home life. However, because of his passion for music, McDonald didn’t fit in with the mainstream students, and subsequently took out his frustrations on other pupils, mirroring his father’s behaviour as he became a school bully, recruiting friends to beat up weaker kids. No doubt he would feel deep shame and remorse in later life, thinking about the violence he dished out to others. In 1986, at age 16, McDonald left school and home, and moved to Sydney, where a musician friend had moved several months earlier. His plan was to become a professional rock musician.</p><p>Years of toiling in factories and warehouses while rehearsing and playing gigs with Sydney hard rock bands such as Warspite, Detriment and Money Tree Seeds began to take a toll on McDonald, who was seeing his dream of becoming a successful musician eaten away by a lack of support, overindulgence in drugs and alcohol and destructive relationships. In 1996 he made the decision to give music a break for a while. But despairing at the thought of becoming a full-time permanent factory worker led him back to school. McDonald began a Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the University of Canberra after quitting work and returning to the ACT. Without a job, McDonald found accommodation in Canberra’s notorious (now demolished) Burnie Court ACT Housing Trust estate. There McDonald met many of the characters that would feature in his work. Growing frustrated with Canberra, McDonald moved back to Sydney and completed a Bachelor of Arts with a double major in English Literature at the University of Western Sydney. Having discovered a passion for reading and writing literature. McDonald then completed a Master of Arts in Creative Writing at the University of Western Sydney, topping his year.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Damian McDonald</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dorall</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canberra</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Australian Capital Territory</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Australia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Damian McDonald ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Luck in the Greater West is a dissection of the lives of a diverse range of people living in twenty-first-century Western Sydney. Through well developed characterisation and strongly evoked setting, the manuscript is a realism piece that explores the themes of multiculturalism, unemployment, employment, drug use and abuse, racism, rape, relationships, sexuality, love, and the diverse socioeconomic milieu of the western suburbs of Sydney. Most fiction novels about Western Sydney don’t get much past the inner-west, dealing with a more fashionable grunge/bohemian existence. Luck in the Greater West, however, deals with that vast accumulation of lives that go virtually voiceless as far as literature is concerned.</p><h2>Damian McDonald Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Damian McDonald is one of the <strong>richest Novelist</strong> from Australia. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Damian McDonald</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Damian McDonald (born Canberra, Australia, 11 September 1969) is a contemporary Australian novelist, who won the 2007 ABC Fiction Award [1] for his novel Luck in the Greater West.

Each of the narratives of the piece have a conclusion. However, as it is a work of realism, not everything concludes as the narrative trajectory would suggest. Testafiglia, despite his growing hate and disappointment, becomes a better father to his now pregnant teenage daughter. Abdullah, who receives a long jail term for the rapes he and his mates inflicted on numerous young women, becomes enlightened after becoming the victim of a serious assault, and then receiving a visit from the young mother of his soon-to-be-born child–Testafiglia’s daughter. Patrick, who has had to deal with the break-up of his relationship with Sonja, begins to put his life back together–in his own way–and moves in with his previous girlfriend, and the reader is witness to the bitter-sweet way this slice of Patrick’s life has turned out.</p><p>Abdullah Najib and his mates love driving through the suburbs in the Subaru WRX, looking for chicks they can all have a lash at. Abdullah is proud to be Lebanese, although he has an increasing dislike for his immediate family who seem to have sunk into the Aussie way of life. He is outwardly very sure of himself, and finds it easy to make people see things his way. But his attitude – like his hormones – is getting out of control. Abdullah’s character is a particularly clear example of the way none of the characters in Luck in the Greater West are simply good or bad, but are all complex combinations of qualities.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Damian McDonald height</b> Not available right now.

His strong European values – that have always been his ally – must sustain an equally strong battering when his life, and more poignantly, the lives of his family become complicated by a rape issue he is dealing with at work. Testafiglia’s teenage daughter is becoming a woman; and fears that he hadn’t fully considered begin to flood into his reality. However, they become the catalyst that sees the humanisation of his character, and a regrowth of the Testafiglia family dynamic.</p><h2>Who is Damian McDonald Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Damian McDonald</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

She is in year nine at the local high school, but is quite bored by the students and the curriculum. She is beyond her years in intelligence, and feels she is yet to find a place in her adopted community. The Marmeladovas live in a Housing Commission flat where, by a random incident, Sonja meets a young man who has recently moved into the same block of flats: Patrick White–back out from his completed jail sentence. The two are immediately attracted to each other and become lovers–complicating their already confused lives, and further complicating the cultural shock her family is suffering in Western Sydney. Sonja and Patrick’s relationship is deep and devouring but, like a narcotic, has side-effects, and for Sonja, after so much indulgence, a moment of clarity.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Daniel Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Novelist</strong>.

He is intelligent, although a little perplexed by what life offers him. Life soon tows Patrick into trouble with the Western Plateau Local Patrol and the subsequent processes of the law. Patrick is sentenced to do some jail time for possession of drugs, but he deals with it the only way he knows how to: as just another – albeit dark – chapter in his life. Patrick’s frank and grounded take on life makes him, despite his uninformed life choices, a character who is thoroughly easy to empathise with.</p>You may read full biography about Damian McDonald from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfma6utcCnZKablKS7orjDZq6roaSav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
