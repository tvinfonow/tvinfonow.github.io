Robert Abele of LA Weekly wrote: “Natalie Dormer presents a painterly exquisiteness and complexity in her portrayal of Anne Boleyn… her enigmatic, time-halting loveliness is a boon for The Tudors, and damn near worth losing your head over”. After her character’s death at the end of the second season, The Boston Herald noted: “Dormer gave Anne Boleyn life, making her not just a beautiful schemer but a rebellious, defiantly independent tragic hero in the tradition of Rebel Without a Cause and Cool Hand Luke… her departure from The Tudors leaves a tremendous void.”</p><h2>Natalie Dormer Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Natalie Dormer is one of the <strong>richest Tv Actress</strong> from United Kingdom.

This was her film debut and it was released in 2005. The director, Lasse Hallström, was so impressed with Dormer’s comedic timing that he had the scriptwriter expand her part. In 2005, Dormer had a small part in Distant Shores. After the filming of Casanova, Dormer was out of work for ten months, which she ascribes to “bad representation”. She was attached to an independent film which kept being delayed because of financial problems. Taken off the audition circuit, Dormer waitressed and worked in data entry to support herself.
