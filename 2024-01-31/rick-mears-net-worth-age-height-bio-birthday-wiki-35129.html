The arrangement also included a ride at the Indianapolis 500.</p><p>In 1979 the National Championship sanction changed from the USAC to CART. At Indianapolis he won his first “500”, staying at the front of the field, taking advantage when Bobby Unser fell out of contention with mechanical trouble.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Rick Mears</b>'s net worth <strong>$15 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>His career began in off-road racing, and he moved on to Indy Car racing in the 1970s.</p><p align=justify>He was the Indycar national champion three times.</p><p align=justify>Rick Ravon Mears (born December 3, 1951), known by the nickname “Rocket Rick”, is a retired American race car driver. He is one of three men to win the Indianapolis 500 four times (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991) and is the current record-holder for pole positions in the race with six (1979, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991). Mears is also a three-time Indycar series/World Series champion (1979, 1981 and 1982).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Race Car Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 1981 and 1982 seasons saw two more championships for Mears. Despite facial burns during a pit fire in the 1981 Indianapolis 500, Mears’ ten race victories in the two-year span were enough for another two Indycar championship titles. At the 1982 Indianapolis 500 he came within 0.16 of a second of adding a second Indy win. With less than 20 laps to go, during Mears’ final pit stop, the crew filled the entire tank rather than giving him only the amount he needed to finish. The delay left him more than 11 seconds behind Gordon Johncock. Mears made up the difference when Johncock suffered handling problems, but failed to secure the win. The photo finish stood for 10 years as the closest finish to an Indy 500. The photo-finish also muffled out the controversial pace-lap crash with teammate Kevin Cogan who appeared to have spun out for no apparent reason; fellow drivers such as Gordon Johncock, Johnny Rutherford, and Bobby Unser, charged Mears with causing the crash by bringing the field down at a slow pace.</p><p>Mears is the brother of Roger Mears, father of off-road and open-wheel racer Clint Mears, and the uncle of former NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series driver Casey Mears.
