Cronin..</p><p>His mother’s death in 1993 led him to found the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund in 1994, a charity funded by exhibitions of Audrey Hepburn memorabilia. He directed the charity in cooperation with his half-brother Luca Dotti, and Robert Wolders, his mother’s last significant other, which thereafter continued the humanitarian work of Audrey Hepburn. Ferrer brought the exhibition “Timeless Audrey” on a world tour to raise money for the foundation. He served as Chairman of the Foundation before resigning in 2012, at which point Dotti became Chairman. In 2017, Ferrer was sued by the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund for alleged self-serving conduct. In October 2017, Ferrer responded by suing the Fund for trademark infringement, claiming that the Fund no longer had the right to use Hepburn’s name or likeness. Ferrer’s suit against the Fund was dismissed in March 2018 due to the complaint’s failure to include Dotti as a defendant. In 2019, Ferrer prevailed in the Fund’s suit against him, with the judge ruling that there was no merit to the charity’s claims that it had the independent right to use Audrey Hepburn’s name and likeness, or to enter into contracts with third parties without Ferrer’s consent.</p><p>He initially worked in the film industry and worked on the design, production and marketing of films.
