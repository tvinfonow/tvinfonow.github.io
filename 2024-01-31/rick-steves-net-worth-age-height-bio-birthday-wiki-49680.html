At the time, he also worked as a piano teacher. In 1979, based on his travel classes, he wrote the first edition of Europe Through the Back Door (ETBD), a general guide on how to travel in Europe. Steves self-published the first edition of his travel skills book ETBD in 1980. The book contained a page that said “Anyone caught reprinting any material herein for any purpose whatsoever will be thanked profusely.” Unlike most guidebook entrepreneurs, he opened a storefront business. Initially, this was both a travel center and a piano teaching studio. He held travel classes and slide show presentations, did travel consulting, organized a few group tours per year, and updated his books. He did not provide ticket booking or other standard travel agency services. He incorporated his business as “Rick Steves’ Europe Through the Back Door.” The store was in Steves’ hometown of Edmonds, north of Seattle. The company’s headquarters is still in Edmonds. Steves’ first television show, Travels in Europe with Rick Steves, debuted on public television in April 1991 and ended production in 1998. His second show, Rick Steves’ Europe, debuted in September 2000, and has aired episodes through 2019, though because he does not produce a season every year, this accounts for 10 seasons.</p><h2>Rick Steves Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Rick Steves is one of the <strong>richest TV Show Host</strong> from United States.
