Daniel Wayne Smith celebrates birthday on January 22 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Dr. Cyril Wecht was hired by Callenders and Co., a Bahamian law firm, to do an independent autopsy. Wecht stated Daniel Smith died as a result of the interaction of methadone, an analgesic, and the antidepressants Zoloft and Lexapro. The metabolism and the breakdown of the methadone is delayed in the presence of Zoloft, according to Wecht. Methadone can alter the cardiac rhythm – it’s referred to as a prolongation of the QT interval. “When that is prolonged, the individual could even lose consciousness, and suffer cardiac dysrhythmia. And that is something that can happen from methadone alone, and in the presence of Zoloft and Lexapro, it is more likely to happen,” “I don’t mean frequently, and certainly not predictably, so tragically, with this young man this is what happened. So I have no question at all as to the cause of death.”</p><h3>Why was Daniel Wayne Smith buried in the Bahamas?</h3><p>Smith will be laid to rest next to her son, Daniel, who died in September 2006.
