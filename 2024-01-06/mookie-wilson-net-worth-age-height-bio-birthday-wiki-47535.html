Former New York Mets center fielder, best known for his ground ball hitting that helped the Mets win 1986 World Series.</p><p>His ground ball, which passed through the legs Red Sox first baseman&nbsp;His ground ball, which went through the legs of Red Sox first baseman <a href=#>Bill Buckner</a> during the 1986 World Series, became one of the most famous plays in baseball history.&nbsp;during 1986 World Series, was one of the most iconic plays in baseball history.</p><p>In the mid-1970s, South Carolina State University, a program located in Orangeburg, South Carolina and very near Wilson’s hometown, discontinued its baseball program just days after Wilson had signed a letter of intent to play for the Bulldogs. As a result, Mookie attended Spartanburg Methodist College for the 1974 & 1975 seasons. While attending Spartanburg Methodist, Mookie was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fourth round of the January 1976 amateur draft but he did not sign. Instead, Mookie transferred to play for The University of South Carolina Gamecocks, preferring to attempt to better his draft stock by playing for former New York Yankees great and fellow South Carolina native Bobby Richardson who was the head coach of the Gamecocks at the time. The gamble paid off as Wilson was selected in the second round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets. Mookie was part of the Gamecocks’ second team to play for a national championship in Omaha, Nebraska in the 1977 College World Series. He was also named to the 1977 All-Tournament team as an outfielder. He earned a B.S. degree from Mercy College.</p><p>The Mets drafted Wilson’s brother John in the 17th round of the 1982 amateur draft. A speedster like his brother, John stole 56 bases for the Columbia Mets of the South Atlantic League in 1984. Mookie also has a brother, Phil, who played minor league ball for the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos. Another brother, Richard, is the biological father of former major league outfielder Preston Wilson. On June 22, 1978, Mookie Wilson married Preston’s mother, Rosa Gilbert, making him both Preston’s stepfather and uncle. Wilson was an outfielder for the Texas League Class AA Jackson Mets at the time of the wedding. The ceremony was conducted at the home plate of Smith-Wills Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi, before a hometown crowd of 1,200 and included an archway of bats held aloft by Wilson’s teammates for the bride and groom’s procession.</p><p align=justify>Rosa Gilbert was his wife at Smith-Wills Stadium’s home plate in 1978.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mookie Wilson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mookie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wilson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bamberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rosa Gilbert</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Preston Wilson</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mookie Wilson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
