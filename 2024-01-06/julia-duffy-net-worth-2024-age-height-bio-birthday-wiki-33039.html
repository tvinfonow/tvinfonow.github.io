The new producers accommodated her, allowing her to then join the cast of Designing Women. Baby Talk was then retooled and Duffy was replaced by Mary Page Keller. She worked again with Clooney some years later in the Coen Brothers’ comedy Intolerable Cruelty. In 1991, she joined the cast of Designing Women, essentially replacing Delta Burke, the show’s breakout star, who was fired after quarrels with producers. Duffy played Allison Sugarbaker, Burke and Dixie Carter’s previously unseen cousin on the show.
