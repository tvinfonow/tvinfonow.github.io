He began his career as a child actor, appearing in the PBS television film Lemon Sky (1988) and the miniseries The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990). He later appeared in three Gus Van Sant films&nbsp;– To Die For (1995), Good Will Hunting (1997), and Gerry (2002)&nbsp;– and in Steven Soderbergh’s comedy heist trilogy Ocean’s Eleven (2001), Ocean’s Twelve (2004), and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007). His first leading role was in Steve Buscemi’s independent comedy-drama Lonesome Jim (2006).</p><p>Affleck acted professionally during his childhood due to his mother’s friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, Patty Collinge. In addition to local weather commercials and movie extra work, he appeared as Kevin Bacon’s brother in the PBS television movie Lemon Sky (1988), directed by Collinge’s husband Jan Egleson, and as a young Robert Kennedy in the ABC miniseries The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990). These early acting experiences “meant nothing more than a day off from school” to Affleck, and he only began to consider a career as an actor when in high school. When he later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career in earnest, his first movie role was as a sociopathic teenager in Gus Van Sant’s 1995 satirical comedy To Die For. During filming in Toronto, Affleck shared an apartment with co-star Joaquin Phoenix and they became close friends. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Affleck’s performance, saying he “skillfully capture[s] the pang of adolescence among no-hopers.” However, Affleck then had a “disappointing” experience while making the 1996 drama Race the Sun and, “as soon as the film finished, I went to school.”</p><p align=justify>He is the younger brother to actor&nbsp;He is the younger brother of fellow actor <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>.

Despite arranging a first meeting between Van Sant and his brother to discuss the project, Affleck was reluctant to leave college temporarily to act in the film. He was eventually persuaded to play one of four friends living in South Boston&nbsp;– a role written specifically for him&nbsp;– and improvised many of his lines. Jay Carr of The Boston Globe praised the “emotional subtleties and variety” of the performances, and singled out “Casey Affleck’s junior member of the quartet, dying to be taken as seriously as the others.” Following the critical and commercial success of the movie, Affleck’s career opportunities did not significantly improve. At the same time, his life became exposed to the public and parts of his life became “part of pop culture and public life.” Also in 1997, he had a small role in Kevin Smith’s Chasing Amy, starring his brother. He returned to university for a semester before quitting to focus on his acting career.</p><h2>Casey Affleck Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Casey Affleck is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actor</strong> from United States.

The surname “Affleck” is of Scottish origin. He also has Irish, German, English, and Swiss ancestry. Affleck’s maternal great-great grandfather, Heinrich Boldt , -known for the discovery of the Curmsun Disc, emigrated from Prussia in the late 1840s. Casey’s mother was a Radcliffe College– and Harvard–educated elementary school teacher. His father worked sporadically as an auto mechanic, a carpenter, a bookie, an electrician, a bartender, and a janitor at Harvard University. In the mid-1960s, he had been a stage manager, director, writer and actor with the Theater Company of Boston. During Affleck’s childhood, his father was “a disaster of a drinker”.

He later remarked: “It dawned on me late that I should be selective about what I do.” In the independent comedy Desert Blue (1998), he starred opposite Kate Hudson as a small-town jock. Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while “interesting”, his character was “entirely underdeveloped”. In 1999, he made an uncredited cameo in the teen comedy American Pie and appeared as a punk rocker romantically involved with both Gaby Hoffmann and Christina Ricci’s characters in the New Year’s Eve ensemble comedy 200 Cigarettes. In the comedy Drowning Mona (2000), starring Danny DeVito, Affleck played a shy gardener suspected of murder. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times acknowledged, in an otherwise negative review, that his role was “well played”. Also in 2000, Affleck had a small role in the comedy Attention Shoppers and played Fortinbras in Ethan Hawke’s Hamlet. He appeared as the brother of Heather Graham’s character in the romantic comedy Committed (2001), with Emanuel Levy of Variety praising a “terrific” performance. Also in 2001, he had a small role in American Pie 2 and appeared in the teen slasher film Soul Survivors. Robert Koehler of Variety found him “bland” while Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle said that he did not make “much of an impression, [but may] have been too depressed to really act.” One positive experience Affleck had during this period was working with Van Sant and cinematographer Harris Savides on Finding Forrester (2000) as Van Sant’s assistant and technical consultant: “Can you imagine a better film school that that? Gus is not only somebody who I love a lot but is also who has taught me, maybe more than anybody else in film.”</p><p>Affleck found a degree of commercial success when he was cast in Steven Soderbergh’s heist comedy Ocean’s Eleven (2001), starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Damon. In roles Soderbergh originally intended for Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson, Affleck and Scott Caan played Mormon brothers and wisecracking mechanics who help to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. While it was a “great, fun social experience,” Affleck spent much of his time on set “being, like, 100 feet away from the camera in the background.” He would later reprise his role in Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Casey Affleck height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Casey <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Affleck has been a vegan since 1995.

Affleck, Damon, and Van Sant conceived of the idea and wrote the screenplay together while living in neighboring New York apartments. The film, which had minimal dialogue, received mixed reviews. Affleck, who rarely watches his own movies, said of Gerry in 2016: “That was an incredible experience. I saw one scene recently out of context at the Telluride Film Festival and I can’t believe anyone ever sat through the whole thing. It probably works better as a whole but one scene lifted out&nbsp;– I thought, ‘This is unbearable!'” Also in 2002, Affleck starred with Damon and then-girlfriend Summer Phoenix in a West End stage production of Kenneth Lonergan’s This Is Our Youth. Lonergan and Affleck became friends during rehearsals, and Affleck later acted in workshop productions of Lonergan’s plays in New York.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Casey Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actor</strong>.

Casey Affleck celebrates birthday on August 12 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Affleck’s first leading role was in 2006’s little-seen independent comedy-drama Lonesome Jim, directed by Steve Buscemi. He played a depressed writer who returns from New York to live with his parents in Indiana, and begins a relationship with Liv Tyler’s character. Buscemi has said he knew Affleck would be able to carry the movie after watching his performance in Gerry. Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post remarked: “Affleck’s interesting .. He probably can’t be a star in big movies because his drawback is a voice that sounds like a snivel drawn through a wet nasal passage into a whine … And yet in certain kinds of films&nbsp;– this kind&nbsp;– he’s 100 percent authentic.” Ty Burr of the Boston Globe said Affleck “gets so far under the skin of this semi-charming jerk that the performance becomes both brave and aggravating.” However, Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt it “would be a stronger movie if Mr. Affleck had the wherewithal to bare more of the passive-aggressive rage inside … a more resourceful actor would have used this blank slate to scrawl a thousand telling details.” Also in 2006, he had a supporting role in the romantic comedy The Last Kiss as a friend of Zach Braff’s character.</p><h3>Are Ben and Casey Affleck full brothers?</h3><table><tr>Casey Affleck</tr><tr><td>Relatives</td><td>Ben Affleck (brother)</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Full list</td></tr></table><h3>What is Casey Affleck doing now?</h3><p><b>He has a new movie out, Every Breath You Take</b>; recently starred in Our Friend alongside Dakota Johnson and Jason Segel; and produced and starred in The World to Come, a critically acclaimed drama opposite Academy Award nominee Vanessa Kirby.</p><h3>Is Casey Affleck Joaquin Phoenix brother in law?</h3><p>Affleck was married to Joaquin’s sister, Summer Phoenix, for 11 years and <b>the brothers-in-law became close friends</b>.
