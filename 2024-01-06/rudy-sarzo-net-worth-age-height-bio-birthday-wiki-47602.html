He is currently the bass player for The Guess Who.</p><p>Upon arriving in Los Angeles in August 1977, Sarzo happened upon a Quiet Riot show at the Starwood after being turned away from a sold-out Van Halen show at the nearby Whisky a Go Go. He recalled the show being “quite ambitious for a club band”, and after the show he bumped into vocalist Kevin DuBrow and the two formed a friendship. Struggling financially, Sarzo moved to New Jersey in the fall of 1977 to join his brother Robert in a Top-40 band called A New Taste. While in New Jersey in the summer of 1978, Sarzo received a phone call from DuBrow asking him if he’d like to fly to Los Angeles and audition for Quiet Riot. He landed in LA the next day, rehearsed with the band and was offered the job, which he accepted. Though he is pictured on the cover of the band’s 1978 album Quiet Riot II, the bass parts were actually played by Kelly Garni, the man Sarzo replaced.</p><p align=justify>Rodolfo Maximiliano Sazo Lavieille Grande Rouiz Payrety Chaumont was born Rodolfo Maximiliano.

His playing can be heard on Osbourne’s Speak of the Devil and Tribute live albums. The liner notes of Osbourne’s 1981 studio album Diary of a Madman list Sarzo as the bassist, though Bob Daisley actually played bass on the recordings.</p><h2>Rudy Sarzo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Rudy Sarzo is one of the <strong>richest Bassist</strong> from Cuba.

While still a member of Osbourne’s band, Sarzo had been helping his former band Quiet Riot by recording the Randy Rhoads’ tribute song “Thunderbird” for their upcoming Metal Health album as a means of coping with his grief. In stark contrast to the chaos surrounding everyday life on the road with the hard-drinking Osbourne, the experience was so positive that Sarzo ended up recording most of the Metal Health album with his former band and he made the decision to officially rejoin Quiet Riot once the Diary of a Madman tour had concluded.</p><p>Sarzo was a member of Quiet Riot during the peak of the band’s success, and he appeared in numerous MTV videos and was voted 1983’s Top Bassist by the readers of Circus magazine. Sarzo remained with Quiet Riot from September 1982 to January 1985, when friction caused by vocalist DuBrow’s constant slagging of rival bands in the press convinced him to leave the band.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Rudy Sarzo height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Rudy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Shortly after joining Quiet Riot, Sarzo began teaching bass guitar at Musonia music school at the request of bandmate Randy Rhoads. The pair became disillusioned by Quiet Riot’s inability to land an American recording contract (their albums had been released in Japan only at that point), and Rhoads soon left the band after accepting an offer to form a new band with ex-Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Quiet Riot played a farewell show at the Starwood on October 2, 1979, after which Rhoads left for England to write songs with Osbourne. With Quiet Riot officially disbanded, Sarzo joined a band called Private Army with drummer and longtime friend Frankie Banali.</p><p align=justify>After leaving Quiet Riot, Sarzo formed M.A.R.S. with former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate Tommy Aldridge, with whom Sarzo maintained a close friendship. From April 1987 to September 1994, both Sarzo and Aldridge were members of Whitesnake before lead singer David Coverdale put the band on indefinite hiatus.</p><h2>Who is Rudy Sarzo Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Rudy Sarzo</strong> married to <strong>Rebecca Sarzo </strong>.

Months later when Osbourne and Quiet Riot found themselves on the same bill at the 1983 US Festival, Osbourne flew into a drunken rage upon seeing Sarzo, punching him in the face before being hauled away by security.
