Taking off with the public as a legitimate musical act, they performed live gigs and in 1978 released the hit album Briefcase Full of Blues (drawn from the fact that Aykroyd, as “Elwood Blues”, carried his blues harmonicas in a briefcase that he kept handcuffed to his wrist, in the manner of a CIA courier; Belushi originally carried the key to those handcuffs). Briefcase Full of Blues eventually sold 3.5 million copies, and is one of the highest-selling blues albums of all time. The band was much further popularized in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers, which Aykroyd co-wrote. A sequel, titled Blues Brothers 2000, was released in 1998 and featured John Goodman as Belushi’s replacement.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Dan Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Actor</strong>.

Aykroyd joked that the green ghost, later known as “Slimer”, was “the ghost of John Belushi” and was based on Belushi’s party animal personality.
