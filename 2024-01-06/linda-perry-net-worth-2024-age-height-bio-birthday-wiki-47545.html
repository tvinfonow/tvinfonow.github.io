During sessions at Interscope studios in Los Angeles, the band struggled to come up with a followup to Bigger, and Perry left the band during the attempt to pursue a solo career. The band recorded one last video, for a cover of Led Zeppelin’s “Misty Mountain Hop” with Dave Navarro on guitar.</p><p>In February 1994, Perry had a solo appearance in Roger Daltrey’s production, album and video A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who.

After several years of playing locally and negotiating with various record companies, the band finally signed with Interscope Records and released its debut album, Bigger, Better, Faster, More! on October 9, 1992. The album, featuring Perry as lead singer and dominated by her compositions, was an immediate success and spawned a hit single, the Perry-penned “What’s Up?” (often erroneously called “What’s Going On?” after its prominent chorus lyric).</p><p align=justify>In 1997, Perry produced a film, Pink as the Day She Was Born, featuring cameos by Les Claypool of Primus and comedian Margaret Cho.

Interscope insisted on choosing the album’s producer; the production team selected was Bill Bottrell and members of the Tuesday Night Music Club, who had recently produced Sheryl Crow’s debut. Released in 1996, In Flight was moody, mellow and, at times, dark, far removed from the 4 Non Blondes sound. The release received positive notices, but was a poor seller. Perry joined Red Fish, Blue Fish for her world tour, supporting such acts as The Who. She promoted her CD with her own funds, including an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, during which she participated in “lesbian dial-a-date” and performed her former band’s only hit single, “What’s Up?” Perry also hosted the 1997 and 1998 Bammies (Bay Area Music Awards).</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Linda Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Songwriter</strong>.
