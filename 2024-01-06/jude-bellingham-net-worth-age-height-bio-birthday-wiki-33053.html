He was eased into the team on the left wing, moved into central midfield “where he could gain more confidence”, and then used “in a more advanced role” once the staff were sure he could cope with the responsibility. He was EFL Young Player of the Month for November 2019. According to head coach Pep Clotet, Bellingham himself “feels more comfortable in midfield, and more comfortable when he can get closer to the opposition box.”</p><p>Bellingham took up a two-year scholarship with Birmingham City to begin in July 2019. He was part of the first-team squad that spent a week in Portugal as part of their pre-season training, played and scored in pre-season friendlies, and was given squad number 22 for the 2019–20 season. On 6 August 2019, Bellingham became Birmingham City’s youngest ever first-team player&nbsp;– at the age of 16&nbsp;years, 38&nbsp;days, beating the record of 16 years 139 days set by Trevor Francis in 1970&nbsp;– when he started the EFL Cup first round visit to Portsmouth. He played for 80 minutes in the 3–0 defeat, and was the Birmingham Mail’s man of the match. He made his first Football League appearance 19 days later, as a second-half substitute in a 3–0 defeat away to Swansea City, and his home debut on 31 August against Stoke City. Entering the game after half an hour to replace the injured Jefferson Montero, Bellingham went on to score the winning goal&nbsp;– albeit via a generous deflection&nbsp;– as Birmingham came back from 1–0 down to beat Stoke 2–1, and thus became Birmingham’s youngest ever goalscorer, at the age of 16 years and 63 days. He started the next match, away to Charlton Athletic two weeks later, and scored the only goal from Kerim Mrabti’s cutback.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jude Bellingham height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Des <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an under-8. He played for their under-18 team at 14, and made his debut for their under-23 team at the age of 15, on 15 October 2018 away to Nottingham Forest’s U23s. Entering the game after an hour, he scored the only goal in the 87th minute “sliding in to force the ball over the goal line after pressure by Kyle McFarlane on the keeper diverted the ball into his path.” By March 2019, he had three goals from ten development squad appearances, had featured in FourFourTwo’s list of the “50 most exciting teenagers in English football”, and was being mentioned as of interest to major European clubs. He was gradually introduced to the first-team environment while still a schoolboy, increasingly training with the seniors, accompanying them on matchday to observe, and, in March 2019, travelling as the “19th man” for the visit to West Bromwich Albion in the Championship.</p><h2>Who is Jude Bellingham Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jude Bellingham</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
