Who is Brianna Wu dating now & how much money does Brianna Wu have?</p><h2>Brianna Wu Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Brianna Wu</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Game Designer</strong> who was born on <strong>July 6, 1980</strong> in West Virginia, <strong>United States</strong>. American Video game designer and programmers who is most popular for her role in co-founding the independent firm for game design and development Giant Spacekat.&nbsp;From 2014 until 2016 she was the host of The Isometric game podcast.</p><p>She and journalist for video games&nbsp;She and video games journalist <a href=#>Anita Sarkeesian</a> were both targets of Gamergate-related harassment.&nbsp;were both the victims of harassment based on Gamergate.</p><p>In early 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation closed its investigation of the matter. The FBI identified four men who sent threats and obtained confessions from two of them, one of whom stated that they had sent the threat as a “joke” but “understood that it was a federal crime to send a threatening communication to anyone and will never do it again”. The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts declined to prosecute, giving no specific reason. Reacting to the report, Wu stated the FBI did not care about the investigation and that she was “livid”. In the wake of the 2019 Poway synagogue shooting, however, she said that the FBI needs dedicated agents who understand on-line culture (8chan in particular).</p><p>In late October 2017, Wu used the streaming service Twitch to raise awareness for her Congressional campaign. This appears to be the first instance of anyone using Twitch in this manner. “One of the reasons Millennials feel disenfranchised is politicians don’t speak to them in ways that feel genuine,” said Wu. “Twitch is one of the most important ways to engage younger people.” When asked, neither Twitch, the DNC nor the Pew Research Center were aware of anyone having had done such previously. Wu was playing Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus during the stream.</p><p align=justify>Her adoptive father was an U.S. Navy doctor.&nbsp;She was married to musician Frank Wu in 2008.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brianna Wu</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brianna</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wu</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Game Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1980</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>West Virginia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Frank Wu</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brianna Wu ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In 2003 she enrolled at the University of Mississippi, studying journalism and political science. At the age of 19, she formed a small animation studio to create an animated pilot episode.
