Rouda was born in Columbus, Ohio on December 10, 1961. He is the son of Marlese Rouda Sr. and Harley Edwin Rouda Sr.&nbsp;He is the youngest child of four.</p><p>Rouda claims he was raised in “traditional Republican households.”&nbsp;He was a registered Republican from 1997 until 1997 when he decided to become an independent. He felt that the Republican Party was moving in the wrong direction on social issues.&nbsp;Rouda claims that the last Republican for whom he voted was Bob Dole during the 1996 presidential election.&nbsp;After the 2016 election, he switched to the Democratic Party as his party affiliation.&nbsp;Rouda gave to the John Kasich 2016 presidential election campaign shortly before registering as a Democrat.&nbsp;Kasich would end his campaign shortly after he was defeated in the California primaries by Donald J. Trump.&nbsp;These donations led to Kasich being criticised by Democrats for not being loyal enough to the party and for being “Republican in disguise” during his campaign.</p><p>On March 2, 2017, Rouda announced his candidacy for U.S. Representative from California’s 48th congressional district , challenging the incumbent, Dana Rohrabacher, shortly after changing his party registration from no party preference into a Democrat. His primary opponent, Hans Keirstead, was endorsed by the Democratic Party of California at the party convention. Rouda received the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee endorsement in May 2018. In the nonpartisan blanket primary election, Rouda secured the second spot over Keirstead on the ballot by 125 votes (from a total of 174,024), thus allowing him to face Rohrabacher in the general election.</p><p>On October 25, Michael Bloomberg announced he would be supporting Rouda’s campaign by donating $4&nbsp;million to his PAC, Independence USA. That made Rouda’s race against Rohrabacher the most expensive House race in the 2018 election cycle.</p><p align=justify>Rouda was licensed to practice law in Ohio after passing the Ohio bar exam. He worked there until 1990.&nbsp;Rouda was a business lawyer who specialized in securities work, business formation and intellectual property.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harley Rouda</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rouda</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Columbus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kaira Rouda</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Harley Rouda ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
