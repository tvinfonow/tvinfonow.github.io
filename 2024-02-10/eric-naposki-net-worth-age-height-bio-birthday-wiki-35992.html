Eric Andrew Naposki (born December 20th 1996) is a man who was convicted of murder who is currently in prison for life without parole.&nbsp;He was a former professional footballer which played with the National Football League and World League of American Football from 1988 until 1997.&nbsp;He was a part of two seasons for the New England Patriots, one season with the Indianapolis Colts, and four seasons with the Barcelona Dragons, winning World Bowl V in his final season.&nbsp;When he was with Barcelona Dragons, Naposki recorded 16.5 sacks over 3.5 seasons, scoring one touchdown, an interception as well as numerous blocked punts and field goals.&nbsp;Naposki was also an in-camp reserve player for both the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Jets.</p><p>Naposki has always been adamant about his innocence and is currently contesting his conviction.&nbsp;Naposki was found guilty on circumstantial evidence because no weapon was ever discovered.&nbsp;There was no DNA, there were no fingerprints, no eyewitnesses , and there was no tape of surveillance.&nbsp;The defense claims that the 16-year delay in indictment led to the destruction of evidence to support his claim (which was deemed to be valid in the eyes of an DA at the time of 1995 but before it was found out that the place in which he was bouncer was just 100 yards away from the scene of the crime).</p><p>On May 21, 2009, Naposki was arrested in Connecticut and charged with a murder committed in December 1994 in Newport Beach, California.

On January 23, 2012, a jury also convicted Nanette Johnston for the murder. On August 10, 2012, Naposki was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.</p><p>The TV series American Greed showed an episode about the murder in January 2017. The CBS TV series 48 Hours aired, on 29 October 2011, the episode titled “Murder in the O.C.”. Naposki claims that he is innocent and is interviewed about his conviction.</p><p align=justify>The decision was a blow to Naposki who’s professional football career was booming throughout Europe as a player of the Barcelona Dragons during the 1990s in the 1990s, to continue serving life sentences without the possibility of parole within Corcoran State Prison, also the home of notorious killer Charles Manson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Eric Naposki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Eric</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Naposki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Eric Naposki ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
