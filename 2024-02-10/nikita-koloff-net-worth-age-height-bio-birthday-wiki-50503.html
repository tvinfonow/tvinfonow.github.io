Koloff was born the 9th of March 1959. He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, one of four children born to Paige and Olive Simpson.&nbsp;At the age of two old, his dad resigned from the family and left his mother to become sole parent.&nbsp;Koloff was Koloff was 10 years old, his family moved into the suburban area of Robbinsdale.&nbsp;When he was in the junior year of high school Koloff was able to begin weight lifting.&nbsp;He was a student at Robbinsdale High School where he was a member of Robbinsdale’s Robbinsdale Robins football team as defensive lineman, as well as on offense. He was also an all conference wide receiver.&nbsp;Students from his class included potential pro-wrestlers Barry Darsow, Brady Boone, Curt Hennig, John Nord, Rick Rude, and Tom Zenk.</p><p>The years 1985 and 1986 Koloff wrestled in a number of matches in 1985 and 1986 for Capitol Sports Promotions in Puerto Rico as part of a talent exchange wrestling Hercules Ayala on several occasions.&nbsp;One time, Koloff sustained a cut to his arm when someone in the crowd was thrown a spark plug at his body.</p><p>Continuing to improve, Koloff became a big enough heel to get a match against NWA World Champion Ric Flair at The Great American Bash 1985 on July 6. Koloff lost to Flair and was even attacked by a fan during the match, but he established himself as a superstar in the wrestling business. According to Koloff, it was his favourite match of his career.</p><p>Prior to committing themselves with Jim Crocket Promotions, The Koloffs feuded with then AWA World tag team champions the Road Warriors in both the AWA and the NWA in a brutal series during 1985. One of their encounters was voted Match of the Year runner-up by the readers of Pro Wrestling Illustrated. The feud was often fought in steel cage Russia chain matches, with lights-out stipulations. The Russian ‘chain match’, using thicker chains than normal chain matches, was considered a Nikita Koloff specialty.</p><p align=justify>The year was 1984 and Simpson had planned to attempt to join the USFL when Road Warrior Animal, a professional wrestler from the Minnesota region, contacted him to invite him to join the professional wrestling team.&nbsp;Simpson chose to pursue wrestling and was instructed to shave off his head and appear.&nbsp;Jim Crockett, Jr. who was the promoter of NWA’s Jim Crockett Promotions, renamed the wrestler “Nikita Koloff”, the Russian Nightmare, and teamed with “uncle” Ivan Koloff and Don Kernodle, a turncoat American.&nbsp;Koloff was briefly instructed with Eddie Sharkey.&nbsp;He made his debut on the 5th of June 1984. He was victorious in his first match in 13 seconds. the only rule by Crockett was that in the event that Koloff slip onto the ropes, he’d be sacked immediately.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nikita Koloff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nikita</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Koloff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Professional Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Minneapolis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Minnesota</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Victoria Koloff , Mandy Smithson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kolby Koloff, Kendra Koloff</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Nikita Koloff ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev had been growing in popularity throughout the country with his political reform of Glasnost and Perestroika. The era of evil Russian heels was coming to an end. Rhodes decided to strike while the iron was hot, booking Koloff to become a face and his greatest ally against The Four Horsemen. The historic moment took place on October 24 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Rhodes needed a partner to take on Ole Anderson and James J. Dillon in a cage match. The fans in Charlotte erupted when Koloff entered the cage to help Rhodes. Koloff stated that even though he and Magnum T.A. had a bitter rivalry, T.A. had earned his respect, and that Nikita would work to earn the respect of the American people. This evening established Koloff as one of the top faces in the NWA.</p><h2>Nikita Koloff Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Nikita Koloff is one of the <strong>richest Professional Wrestler</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Nikita Koloff</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Nikita Koloff (born Nelson Scott Simpson on March 9 1959) is an American retired professional wrestler.&nbsp;The most well-known of his appearances is his time as a member of Jim Crockett Promotions and its successor, World Championship Wrestling between 1984 and 1992, when it was reported that he came as being from Russia (and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lithuania).&nbsp;In his time, Koloff held championships including the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, NWA World Television Championship as well as the UWF World Television Championship.&nbsp;Koloff was inducted into both The George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2006, and The National Wrestling Alliance Hall of Fame of 2008.</p><p align=justify>Koloff completed his high school graduation in.&nbsp;He was enrolled at Golden Valley Lutheran College where was a college football player alongside the future wrestler Joe “Animal” Laurinaitis.&nbsp;He was injured while during a game of football, but was able to participate in Minnesota State University Moorhead where there was another injury.</p><p align=justify>The Koloffs went on to regain the NWA World Tag Team title from the Rock ‘N Roll Express three months later, on October 13, but lost it to the same opponents on November 28 at StarrCade 1985 in a steel cage match.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Professional Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The following month, Koloff defeated Wahoo McDaniel to unify his US Title with Wahoo’s NWA National Heavyweight Championship on September 28. He was readying to embark on a feud with Ron Garvin that would last through the upcoming Starrcade 1986. The idea of head booker Dusty Rhodes was for Koloff to reignite his feud with Magnum T.A. the following year. The plan called for T.A. to defeat Ric Flair for the NWA World Championship at StarrCade 86; after a short program of rematches with Flair, T.A. would begin a long program with Koloff that ran through The Great American Bash Tour of 1987. As of the beginning of October, Rhodes had not decided whether to give Koloff the title at some point during the feud.</p><p>In spring of 1986, Koloff started one of the biggest, most anticipated feuds in the history of Jim Crockett Promotions when he attacked NWA United States Heavyweight Champion Magnum T.A.. Following an incident where Magnum hit on-screen NWA President Bob Geigel for demanding an apology after T.A. started a brawl with Nikita during a contract signing (which started when the Koloffs berated Magnum’s mother, who was present), T.A. was stripped of his title. The two were then booked in a best-of-seven series, which took place during The Great American Bash 1986 tour. The winner of the series would be declared champion. Koloff and T.A. wrestled all summer, ending up tied after six matches with one no contest. The final match took place on August 17 and featured run-ins by Kruschev and Ivan and several false-finishes. Nikita defeated T.A. to win the title.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Nikita Koloff height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Nikita <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With Kernodle out of the picture, Uncle Ivan Koloff introduced a new comrade named Krusher Khruschev. In December 1984, Jim Crockett rewarded the Russians with the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. Three months later, on March 18, 1985, Koloff and Ivan defeated Dusty Rhodes and Manny Fernandez to win the NWA World tag team title. Ivan invoked the Freebird rule which dictated that any two of the three could defend the titles. Ivan and Krusher lost the titles to The Rock ‘n’ Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) on July 9.</p><p align=justify>In the fall of 1987, Jim Crockett Promotions acquired Bill Watts’ Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). Dusty Rhodes decided which members of the UWF roster to retain and how best to use the infusion of new talent that he now had access to on an exclusive basis, beginning with a cross-promotional program between NWA Television Champion Koloff and UWF Television Champion, Terry Taylor. The feud began when Taylor, alongside his fellow members of Hot Stuff International, Inc. – Eddie Gilbert and Rick Steiner- attacked Koloff and stole his championship belt. Koloff and Taylor were booked to face each other in a unification bout at StarrCade ’87, but Koloff vowed to get his TV belt back before the match. During a TBS World Championship Wrestling (WCW) broadcast leading up to what would be Jim Crockett’s first foray into pay-per-view, Taylor and Gilbert jumped Koloff again, beating him unconscious, and draping his version of the TV title across his limp body. On November 26, Koloff and Taylor battled in what would be the only NWA/UWF unification bout at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago. In front of his first pay-per-view audience, Nikita became the undisputed Television Champion by defeating Taylor on November 26. He still has the UWF belt as a trophy from that night.</p><h2>Who is Nikita Koloff Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Nikita Koloff</strong> married to <strong>Victoria Koloff , Mandy Smithson </strong>.

The worked injury set up the pretext for dropping the US Title to Lex Luger. On July 11, 1987 Koloff faced Luger in a steel cage match and was defeated after being hit with a chair. This ended Koloff’s reign of nearly 11 months, which still stands today as the fifth longest U.S. title reign in the more than 33-year history of the title.
