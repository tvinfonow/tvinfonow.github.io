Steve Watts (born 11 July 1976) is an English retired footballer and poker professional who last played for Sutton United. He made over 100 Football League appearances for Leyton Orient. Watts is now a professional poker player who has cashed for a total of $777,429 up to and including September 2016.</p><p>Watts trialled at Bristol Rovers in January 2003. He was loaned again, this time to Dagenham & Redbridge on 10 February 2003, making four appearances and scoring 1 goal. In March he was then signed by Shrewsbury Town manager Kevin Ratcliffe. Watts revealed that Swansea City manager Brian Flynn also made contact with him prior to his signing for the Gay Meadow side on transfer deadline day.</p><p>Watts was signed by St Albans City in February 2004. He made 21 appearances, scoring nine times and receiving three cautions. He is remembered for his stunning injury time goal against Bedford Town in the play-off win which saw City promoted to the Conference South.</p><p>A year later Watts fired Fish to promotion as he chipped in with 37 goals winning the Isthmian League Player of the year award in the process. In the 2005/06 Premier Division play-offs, scoring the winner in the semi final against AFC Wimbledon and a 30-yard curler just 4 days later in the final. New Fisher manager Sami Muduroglu said on the move; ‘Steve has been a fantastic servant to this football club. Everyone at the club is extremely sorry to see him go but it was a personal decision made by Steve, not the club. Steve feels that at 29, he needs to concentrate on other directions in his life and could no longer commit to full-time football. I respect that decision and I hope the supporters can understand Steve’s reasons as well. He’s been brilliant for this football club and everyone at Fisher wishes Steve all the best with his future endeavours.’</p><p align=justify>Watts debuted for Shrewsbury Town in April 2003. He started 7 games and came on as sub in 8 more, however his tally was only one goal. On 17 October 2003 he was signed on a free transfer to Football Conference side Dagenham & Redbridge for the 2003–04 season. Watts was to depart The Daggers the same season, initially to Singapore, however this move fell through.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve Watts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steve</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1976</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peckham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peckham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Steve Watts ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
