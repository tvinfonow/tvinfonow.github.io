Who is Kaws dating now & how much money does Kaws have?</p><h2>Kaws Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kaws</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Artist</strong> who was born on <strong>November 4, 1974</strong> in Jersey City, New Jersey, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Donnelly was born in 1974 in Jersey City, New Jersey where he attended St. Anthony High School. As a teenager, he painted his tag “KAWS” on the roof of an area building so that he could see it outside while attending class in high school. He went on to attend the School of Visual Arts in New York City, receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts in illustration in 1996. Following graduation, he briefly worked for Jumbo Pictures as a freelance animator painting backgrounds for the animated series 101 Dalmatians, Daria and Doug. Animator by day, and graffiti artist by night, Donnelly created a name for himself, KAWS, based on the way the letters looked and the word in fact has no meaning. Illegal graffiti was the first step of Kaws learning his craft. After moving to New York City in the 1990s, he started subvertising billboards, bus shelters, and phone booths using a key gifted to him by friend and fellow graffiti artist, Barry Mcgee, as well as bus shelters using a key he created for himself. Since, he has subvertised in Paris, London, Berlin, and Tokyo. In 1999 KAWS made his first toy, Companion, a vinyl figure of Mickey Mouse with x-ed out eyes, with Japanese company Bounty Hunter. His influences come from traditional life painters, such as Gerhard Richter, Claes Oldenburg, and Chuck Close, and he has been compared to the likes of Andy Warhol for his appeal across the market and ability to blur lines between commercial and fine art.</p><p>Brian Donnelly (born November 4, 1974), known professionally as Kaws (stylized as KAWS), is an American artist and designer. His work includes repeated use of a cast of figurative characters and motifs, some dating back to the beginning of his career in the 1990s, initially painted in 2D and later realised in 3D. Some of his characters are his own creations while others are reworked versions of existing icons.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kaws</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kenneth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taylor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Artist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jersey City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Julia Chiang</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sunny Donnelly</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kaws ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
