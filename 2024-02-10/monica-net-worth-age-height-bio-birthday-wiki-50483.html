Amazed by her voice, Dallas offered her a record deal with his Arista Records-distributed label Rowdy Records and consulted rapper Queen Latifah to work as Monica’s first manager. Shortly afterwards Dallas and then staff producers Tim & Bob entered the studio with Monica to start writing and producing her debut Miss Thang, which was eventually released in July 1995 and reached number thirty-six on the U.S. Billboard 200 and number seven on the Top R&B Albums chart. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies and produced three top ten singles, including debut single “Don’t Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)” and “Before You Walk Out of My Life”, which made Monica the youngest artist ever to have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot R&B Singles chart. Miss Thang subsequently won Monica a Billboard Music Award and garnered her an American Music Award nomination in the Favorite Soul/R&B New Artist category.</p><h2>Monica Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Monica is one of the <strong>richest R&B Singer</strong> from Brazil.

The following year she was asked to team up with singer Brandy and producer Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins to record “The Boy Is Mine”, the first single from both of their second albums. Released in May 1998, surrounding highly publicized rumors about a real-life catfight between both singers, the duet became both the biggest hit of the summer and the biggest hit of 1998 in general in America, spending thirteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It earned the pair a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal” and garnered multi-platinum sales (to date, it remains as one of the top twenty most successful American singles in history based on Billboard chart success). Jermaine Dupri, David Foster and Austin consulted on the album The Boy Is Mine, which was released later that year and eventually became Monica’s biggest-selling album, becoming certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies. It yielded another two U.S. number-one hits with “The First Night” and “Angel of Mine”, a cover of Eternal’s 1997 single, as well as a remake of Richard Marx’ “Right Here Waiting”. Rolling Stone proclaimed it “closer to soul’s source… harking back past hip-hop songbirds like Mary J. Blige and adult-contemporary sirens like Toni Braxton”, while AllMusic called the album an “irresistible sounding [and] immaculately crafted musical backdrop […] as good as mainstream urban R&B gets in 1998.” Monica has also made guest appearances on several television shows such as Living Single (1996), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1997, 1999).</p><p>Monica’s popularity was further enhanced by her roles in television series such as Living Single (1996), Felicity (2001), and American Dreams (2003), and films including Boys and Girls (2000), Love Song (2000), and Pastor Brown (2009). A contributor to the NBC talent show The Voice, in 2008, she appeared in the Peachtree TV reality show special Monica: The Single which tracked the recording of the song “Still Standing” along with her personal life and resulted in her own highly rated BET series Monica: Still Standing, containing a similar concept. Separated from rapper Rodney “Rocko” Hill, father of her first two children, Monica married professional basketball player Shannon Brown in November 2010. Their first child together, a daughter, was born in 2013.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Monica height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Monica <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Monica has sold 5.3 million albums in the United States and she is recognized as one of the most successful urban R&B female vocalists to emerge in the mid to late 1990s. According to Billboard, she is the youngest recording act to ever have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the Billboard Top R&B Singles chart, as well as the first artist to top the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart over the span of three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). In 2010, Billboard listed Monica at number 24 on its list of the Top 50 R&B and Hip Hop Artists of the past 25 years. A four-time nominee, she won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for “The Boy Is Mine” at the 41st awards ceremony and has been the recipient of one Billboard Music Award, one BET Award, and two BMI Pop Awards.</p><p align=justify>In 2000, Monica contributed chorus vocals for “I’ve Got to Have It”, a collaboration with Jermaine Dupri and rapper Nas. Released as the Big Momma’s House theme song, the song saw minor success in the United States only. The following year, she released the Ric Wake production track “Just Another Girl”, recorded for the Down to Earth soundtrack, as a single. A year later, Monica channeled much of her heavily media-discussed experiences into the production of her third studio album, All Eyez on Me, her first release on mentor Clive Davis newly founded J Records label. “I just wanted to give the people back something that had personal passion, instead of just, ‘Oh, let’s dance to this record’,” she said about the issues worked into the tracks. The first single “All Eyez on Me”, a Rodney Jerkins-produced R&B-dance track, saw minor to moderate success on the international charts but failed to enter the higher half of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. A follow-up song, “Too Hood”, also got a lukewarm response and as a result, the album’s tentative release was pushed back several times. “I don’t think people wanted to hear a big fun record from me, after knowing all the things that I had personally experienced,” Monica second-guessed her new material which saw both early and heavy bootlegging via internet at that time.</p><h2>Who is Monica Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Monica</strong> married to <strong>Shannon Brown </strong>.

Weems then, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. “Afterward, I felt, ‘What else could I have done?’ You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'” Monica said in an interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. “It’s just something that it’s never possible for me to go back and change.” Monica briefly dated rapper C-Murder up until he got incarcerated for murder in 2003.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Monica Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular R&B Singer</strong>.
