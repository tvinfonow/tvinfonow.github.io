Warren is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>T. J. Warren</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Warren decided to stay for his sophomore year despite being rated as one of the top 31 prospects in the NBA draft during his freshman year. His main influence was his father who convinced him that playing another year at NC State would benefit Warren more, by allowing him to further develop his basketball skills and also improve his draft spot for the NBA. His father is Tony Warren Sr., who played for NC State from 1977 to 1979 under Norm Sloan. Warren was only averaging 27 minutes a game his freshman season but knew his minutes would increase during his sophomore year. This is due to NC State’s basketball team losing all of their starters from the previous year when he was a freshman. Warren showed great potential as a player, but during his freshman year he did not have many opportunities on the court to show his talent due to his playing time.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At the end of the 2014 season, Warren was one of the top in the ACC in offensive rebounds and was among the league leaders in both overall rebounding and steals.
