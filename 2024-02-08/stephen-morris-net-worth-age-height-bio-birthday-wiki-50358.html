English musician best known as the drummer for the influential bands New Order and Joy Division.</p><p>He formed the side project Bad Lieutenant alongside Blur bassist <a href=#>Alex James</a>.</p><p>Stephen Paul David Morris (born 28 October 1957) is an English multi-instrumentalist, composer and record producer who is best known for his work with the rock band New Order and, previously, Joy Division. He also wrote and performed in The Other Two, a band consisting of Morris and his wife, Gillian Gilbert. Morris also participated in the New Order spin-off band Bad Lieutenant. He is known for his precise drumming that seamlessly weaves with New Order’s and Joy Division’s drum machine sounds.</p><p>Morris is noted for his “machine-like” skills as a drummer, which he credits to krautrock influences. The drummers he named as musical inspiration, were Jaki Liebezeit of Can and Moe Tucker of the Velvet Underground because they “were the ones who kept it simple”. He also cited John French a.k.a Drumbo of Captain Beefheart among his main influences. From 1977, he was interested by the music of Siouxsie and the Banshees because their “drummer Kenny Morris played mostly toms”; “hearing the sessions they’d done on John Peel’s show and reading gigs write-ups”, […] inspired him. During Joy Division recording sessions with Martin Hannett, Morris was asked to record his parts one drum at a time so that Hannett could have complete control over the production. He also took an early interest in drum machines, combining them with traditional drumming on many Joy Division and New Order releases.</p><p align=justify>His wife <a href=#>Gillian Gilbert</a> has also played with New Order.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen Morris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Morris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gillian Gilbert (m. 1993)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tilly Morris, Grace Morris</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stephen Morris ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
