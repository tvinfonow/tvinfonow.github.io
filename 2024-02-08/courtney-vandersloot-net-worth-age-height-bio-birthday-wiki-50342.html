Point guard who was drafted as 3rd in 2011’s WNBA Draft from Chicago Sky. Chicago Sky.</p><p>She has been rewarded with a lot of public praise from her co-star Gonzaga basketball player (and NBA legend)&nbsp;She has received strong public praise from fellow Gonzaga point guard (and NBA legend) <a href=#>John Stockton</a>..</p><p>That season, she had averaged more than 18 points and 7 assists as she led Kentwood to its first state tournament appearance; they would lose in the second round of the tournament to Spokane’s University High, led by future Tennessee star Angie Bjorklund. After that season, Vandersloot was asked by many people if she would consider Washington or another Pac-10 school, but decided against it after a Pac-10 assistant told Hennig she was too small. She would eventually sign with Gonzaga in November 2006, during her senior year at Kentwood; she noted in 2011, “I wasn’t really being highly recruited and I just didn’t want to go through the stressful recruiting process, so I committed early to Gonzaga.”</p><p>As a freshman in 2007–08, she was the West Coast Conference newcomer of the year and named to the 10-member All-WCC first team after averaging 10.3 points, 5.7 assists, and 1.9 steals per game entering the WCC tournament, finishing in the top five in the WCC in the latter two categories while the Zags went 13–1 in conference play and earned the tournament’s top seed. However, the Bulldogs lost in the WCC final to San Diego and ultimately missed out on the NCAA Tournament, playing instead in the WNIT. They defeated UC Davis in the first round before falling to Colorado in the second round.</p><p align=justify>She was raised and born in Kent, Washington.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Courtney Vandersloot</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Courtney</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vandersloot</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Courtney Vandersloot ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Her relatively small size had been a subject of concern, as was her defense—despite averaging 4.5 steals per game in the 2011 NCAA tournament and ending her Gonzaga career with 366. However, she was seen as likely to be one of the top seven picks, and was ultimately picked third overall by the Chicago Sky. One indicator of her likely draft position was that Indiana Fever coach Lin Dunn, whose team needed depth at point guard going into the 2011 season, signed Shannon Bobbitt in February, convinced that Vandersloot would be picked before the Fever’s turn at #9. John Stockton gave Vandersloot high praise, stating, “I don’t want to dramatize it too much but she’s like Gretzky in hockey. There is something that separates Courtney from others. [Adam] Morrison [a recent Gonzaga men’s standout] was a little bit the same way.”</p><h3>What is Courtney Vandersloot salary?</h3><table><tr>Player (11)AgeBase Salary</tr><tr><td>Courtney Vandersloot</td><td><b>31</b></td><td><b>$206,000</b></td></tr><tr><td>Allie Quigley</td><td>34</td><td>$200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Stefanie Dolson</td><td>28</td><td>$180,250</td></tr><tr><td>Kahleah Copper</td><td>26</td><td>$165,000</td></tr></table><h3>Where did Courtney Vandersloot go to college?</h3><p>Gonzaga University</p><h3>Is Courtney Vandersloot hurt?</h3><p>Chicago Sky guard Courtney Vandersloot <b>sustained an injury to her left knee</b> in Friday night’s game against the New York Liberty.
