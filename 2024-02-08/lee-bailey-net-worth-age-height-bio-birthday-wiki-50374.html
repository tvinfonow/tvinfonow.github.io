His mother was a teacher and nursery school director, and his father an advertising salesman. His parents divorced when he was ten. Bailey attended Cardigan Mountain School and then Kimball Union Academy, where he graduated in 1950. He studied at Harvard University but dropped out in 1952 to join the United States Marine Corps. Bailey was commissioned as an officer and, following flight training, received his Naval Aviator wings in 1954. He served as a jet fighter pilot, and then began to serve as a squadron legal officer.</p><p>In 1954, Sam Sheppard was found guilty in the murder of his wife Marilyn. The case is regarded as one of the inspirations for the television series The Fugitive (1963–1967). In the 1960s, Bailey, at the time a resident of Rocky River, Ohio, was hired by Sheppard’s brother Stephen to help in Sheppard’s appeal. In 1966, Bailey successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that Sheppard had been denied due process, winning a re-trial. A not guilty verdict followed. This case established Bailey’s reputation as a skilled defense attorney and was the first of many high-profile cases.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lee Bailey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hiroyuki</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yamamoto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Attorney</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1933</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Waltham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Patricia Shiers</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bendrix L.

Medina was court-martialed for allegedly allowing the men in the company he commanded to murder My Lai non-combatants. Medina claimed that he never gave orders to kill non-combatants, and that his men killed non-combatants of their own volition. Medina also testified that he was unable to stop the massacre because he did not become aware of it until it was too late. Medina additionally denied personally killing any Vietnamese non-combatants at My Lai, with the exception of a young woman whom two soldiers testified that they had found hiding in a ditch. When she emerged with her hands held up, Medina shot her because, as he claimed at his court-martial, he thought she had a grenade. Medina was acquitted, and subsequently left the Army. He later worked at an Enstrom Helicopter Corporation plant in which Bailey had an ownership stake.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Hiroyuki Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Attorney</strong>.

The Symbionese Liberation Army members participating in the robbery were therefore subject to the death penalty under the felony murder rule.
