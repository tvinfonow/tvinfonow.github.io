She rose to prominence for her work in comedic roles, particularly the lead part of Cindy Campbell in the Scary Movie films (2000–2006). Faris has appeared in a number of films, including The Hot Chick (2002), May (2002), Lost in Translation (2003), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Just Friends (2005), My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006), Smiley Face (2007), The House Bunny (2008), What’s Your Number?

She once described herself as a drama-club “dork,” stating that she used to wear a Christmas-tree skirt in school and did not date until senior year. “I liked guys, but no one really liked me,” she recalled. She then attended the University of Washington and earned a degree in English literature in 1999. Despite her love for acting, Faris admitted she “never really thought [she] wanted to become a movie star” and continued to act “just to make some extra money,” hoping one day to publish a novel. After graduating from college, Faris was going to travel to London, where she had a receptionist job lined up at an ad agency. However, she ended up living in Los Angeles “at the last minute,” once she committed to the idea of pursuing mainstream acting, eventually getting the starring role in Scary Movie.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Anna Faris</b>'s net worth <strong>$30 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was in a frozen yogurt commercial during high school.</p><p align=justify>She was Erica in the final episode of the TV show Friends.&nbsp;She started hosting the show Anna Faris is Unqualified.</p><p align=justify>Anna Kay Faris was born on November 29, 1976, in Baltimore, Maryland, the second child of Jack, a sociology professor, and Karen Faris, a special education teacher. Both her parents, natives of Seattle, Washington, were living in Baltimore at the time of Faris’ birth, as her father had accepted a professorship at Towson University. When Faris was six years old, the family relocated from Baltimore to Edmonds, Washington. Her father worked at the University of Washington as a vice president of internal communications, and later headed the Washington Biotechnology and Biomedical Association, while her mother taught at Seaview Elementary School in Edmonds. Faris has an older brother, Robert, who is also a sociologist and professor at the University of California, Davis. In interviews, Faris has described her parents as “ultra liberal” and said that she and her brother were raised in an irreligious but “very conservative,” traditional atmosphere. At age six, her parents enrolled her in a community drama class for children as they usually encouraged her to act. She enjoyed watching plays and eventually produced her own material in her bedroom with friends who lived in her neighborhood. Faris has said in interviews she often imagined her retainer talking to her, remarking that she would picture herself “on talk shows to talk about [her] talking retainer”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Faris’ break-out role came in 2000 when she starred in the horror-comedy parody film Scary Movie, portraying Cindy Campbell, a play on the character of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in the slasher thriller Scream. It marked her first starring credit, as she had only appeared in small and supporting parts in theater plays and low-budgeted features until then. Faris saw the experience of working on the movie as a “great boot camp” for her, as she told UK’s The Guardian in 2009, explaining that she “hadn’t done much before that. With those movies, you have to be so exact with your props and the physical comedy and everything, so it was a great training ground.” Scary Movie was a major commercial success, ranking atop the box office charts with a US$42 million opening weekend gross. It went on to earn US$278 million worldwide. For her performance, she received nominations for the Breakthrough Female Performance and Best Kiss Awards at the 2001 MTV Movie Awards. Faris subsequently reprised her role in Scary Movie 2, released on July 4, 2001.</p><p>Her next film role was that of the lesbian colleague of a lonely and traumatized young woman in the independent psychological thriller May (2002), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received a release in selected theaters. In its review for May, The Digital Fix found the production to be “one of the finest examples of independent American genre filmmaking” and asserted that Faris played her role “with an infectious level of enthusiasm, frequently skirting the border between a believable performance and one that is completely over the top, but always managing to come down on the right side.” Later in 2002, she starred alongside Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams in the comedy The Hot Chick, about a teenage girl whose mind is magically swapped with that of a 30-year-old criminal. Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail described McAdams and Faris as “talents to watch, but they are let down by everything around them.” The film was a modest commercial success, grossing US$54 million worldwide.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Anna Faris height</b> <strong>5 ft 5 im</strong> Anna <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 5 im</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Faris started dating actor Ben Indra shortly after they met on the set of the 1999 indie slasher film Lovers Lane.

As her character had just “one scene in the movie,” she only spent two days on set in Calgary. For the film, Faris, along with her co-stars, received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.</p><h2>Who is Anna Faris Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Anna Faris</strong> married to <strong>Chris Pratt , Ben Indra </strong>.

Faris felt that the film gave her the chance to get people to know her body of work a “little more,” and called it “the best experience of [her] life” at the time. While Variety remarked Faris “contributes an amusing turn” as her “vacuous movie star” character, New York Times concluded that the actress, “who barely registers in the Scary Movie pictures — and she’s the star — comes to full, lovable and irritating life as a live-wire starlet […] this movie will secure her a career.” Budgeted at US$4 million, Lost in Translation grossed US$119.7 million globally. Also in 2003, she portrayed Cindy Campbell for the third time in Scary Movie 3.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Anna Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actress</strong>.
