However, due to a protracted contract negotiation with the San Diego Chargers, Rivers only reported to the team during the last week of training camp, and incumbent Drew Brees retained his starting job. Rivers began the season as the Chargers’ third quarterback option, behind Doug Flutie, and ahead of the fourth quarterback on the depth chart, Cleo Lemon. Unfortunately for Rivers, Brees went on to have a then-career year and was named to the NFL Pro Bowl while winning the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. Rivers received very limited playing time, playing in only two games. He only threw passes in the second half of the last game of the 2004 season, a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, by which time the Chargers had already clinched a home playoff spot and the AFC West division title. In the victory, he threw his first touchdown pass to fellow rookie Malcom Floyd. He was not on the active roster for San Diego’s Divisional Round playoff loss to the New York Jets.</p><h3>What is the status of Philip Rivers?</h3><p>Philip Rivers on NFL comeback: ‘I have not completely ruled that out’ Roughly seven months after announcing his retirement following 17 pro seasons, Philip Rivers said <b>he hasn’t closed the door on a comeback late in the 2021 season</b>.</p><h3>How many Pro Bowls has Philip Rivers been to?</h3><p>His career playoff record was only 5-7.
