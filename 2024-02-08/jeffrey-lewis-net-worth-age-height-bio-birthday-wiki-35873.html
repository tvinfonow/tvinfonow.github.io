Antifolk singer known for his complex lyrics and his nihilistic worldview and has released singles like “Back When I Was Four.”</p><p>He collaborated on a few tracks with <a href=#>Kimya Dawson</a> and the Dirty Peaches.</p><p>Lewis is often regarded as part of the antifolk movement, foremost because he was one of the many bands and performers (including The Moldy Peaches, Kimya Dawson, Diane Cluck, Regina Spektor, Major Matt Mason USA and Lach) who played in the 1990s at New York’s SideWalk Cafe and its biannual antifolk festivals and open mic events. His music also possesses certain traits of a perceived antifolk style – a downbeat self-deprecating humor, an off-kilter singing style, a mixture of acoustic and ‘punk’ songs which feature themes of everyday occurrences and feelings. Lewis himself does not mind the ‘antifolk’ tag: “I think it’s a cool title. The fact that no one knows what it means, including me, makes it kind of mysterious and more interesting than saying that you’re a singer/songwriter or that you play indie rock.”</p><p>Lewis was born in New York City and grew up on the Lower East Side. He attended State University of New York at Purchase, graduating in 1997 with a degree in Literature. His Senior Literary Thesis was on the comic book Watchmen.</p><p align=justify>He grew up in Manhattan’s Lower East Side; the landmarks of neighborhood are frequently mentioned in his songs.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeffrey Lewis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeffrey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lewis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Folk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jack Lewis</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jeffrey Lewis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
