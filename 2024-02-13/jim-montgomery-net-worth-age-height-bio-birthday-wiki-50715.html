James Peter Montgomery (born June 30 1969) is a Canadian professional coach of ice hockey and an ex-player.&nbsp;He was most recently the head coach for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL).&nbsp;In his playing days, it was his turn to play in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues, Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers, San Jose Sharks, and the Dallas Stars.</p><p>As of 2000, Montgomery became a player for the San Jose Sharks.&nbsp;Montgomery played for most of the season 2000-01 in the Kentucky Thoroughblades but also skated in 28 games for the Sharks.&nbsp;The following season, Montgomery was signed by Dallas Stars and played 9 games with the team for two seasons, with the majority of his time playing for the Utah Grizzlies.&nbsp;Montgomery later played for a year in Russia and one more year playing for the Missouri River Otters before retiring in 2005.</p><p>On May 4, 2018, Montgomery was named as the head coach of the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL). He led the Stars to their first playoff appearance in three years.</p><p>On December 10, 2019, the Stars fired Montgomery for “unprofessional conduct inconsistent with the core values and beliefs of the Dallas Stars and the National Hockey League.” At a press conference, general manager Jim Nill said the situation had come to light the previous weekend, and involved “a material act of unprofessionalism” egregious enough to demand Montgomery’s immediate firing. He did not offer specifics “out of respect for everyone involved,” only saying that it did not involve abuse of players or criminal conduct. Rick Bowness, who joined the team a month after Montgomery’s hiring in May 2018, was named interim coach.</p><p align=justify>It would take another four years before Montgomery returned in the NHL.&nbsp;He was a player for the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in Germany during the 1996-97 season.
