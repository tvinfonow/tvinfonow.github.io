Who is Duncan Robinson dating now & how much money does Duncan Robinson have?</p><h2>Duncan Robinson Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Duncan Robinson</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Basketball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>April 22, 1994</strong> in York, York, <strong>United States</strong>. Born April 22, 1994 in York, Maine, Robinson is the son of the Elisabeth and Jeffrey Robinson and the youngest of their three children (after sister Marta and brother Eli). Jeffrey, who is 6 feet (1.83&nbsp;m), had played one season for the Maine Black Bears. Robinson grew up in the town of New Castle, New Hampshire, where his Maude H. Trefethen Elementary School 6th grade graduating class was composed of four students. He attended Rye Junior High School and elected to attend The Governor’s Academy in Massachusetts rather than Portsmouth High School, which is the public high school for students in New Castle.</p><p>Prior to the November 15, 2013 season opener against Southern Vermont College, Williams was ranked third in the nation according to the preseason poll. Williams lost in the shadow of a home court scheduling conflict despite 5–6 shooting by Robinson. Robinson became the only freshman starter in Maker’s six-year tenure as head coach at Williams. In his 2013–14 freshman season at Williams, Robinson was twice named New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) Player of the Week during the regular season. Williams reached the 2014 NCAA Men’s Division III Basketball Tournament championship game, but fell 75–73 to University of Wisconsin–Whitewater as Robinson scored 17 points. After Williams took a one-point lead with 4.9 seconds left, Wisconsin pushed the ball upcourt without calling time-out to score the winning basket in what Chris Strauss of USA Today described as the best NCAA basketball tournament game of the weekend. Robinson had posted 30 points in the tournament semifinals against bitter rival Amherst College who had defeated Williams in the season’s three previous meetings. Williams finished the season with a 28–5 record. That season, he led Williams in minutes played (a school record 1,110), points scored (548), three-point shots made (81–179), three-point&nbsp;% (45.3), free throw percentage (87.8%), blocks (36) and steals (36). He averaged 17.1 points, 6.5 rebounds and 34.7 minutes per game. Following the season, he was the NESCAC Rookie of the Year and a Second Team All-NESCAC selection. Robinson became Williams’ first freshman to be named All-American (4th team, D3Hoops.com), first D3Hoops.com National Rookie of the Year, first freshman NCAA All-Tournament Team selection and first freshman 500-point scorer. His season was described as “one of the best freshman seasons in Division III men’s basketball history” by Jeremy Leveille of WGAM in a story for NHNotebook.com.</p><p>Robinson is the first player to transfer from Division III to Division I with a full scholarship according to some sources. During the 2014–15 NCAA Division I season, Robinson redshirted for the Michigan Wolverines, meaning that he could not participate in games, but could practice with the team. In December 2014 with assistant coach Jeff Meyer as his rebounder, Robinson broke Stauskas’ Michigan Wolverines’ practice record for three-pointers in a drill (five minutes, one ball, one rebounder) by posting 78, surpassing Stauskas by three.</p><p>Following the 2013–14 season, Maker left Williams to become the head coach for the Marist Red Foxes. Robinson was immediately contacted by schools from the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, Atlantic 10, Ivy League, Patriot League and American East conferences. Among the schools that were interested were Creighton, Boston College and Providence. After his freshman success, he had decided that he would only leave Williams to play for a winning program that was an elite academic institution and that used a system and style that he had become used to. Robinson had played against Nik Stauskas in NEPSAC play and was impressed with how Michigan’s John Beilein had developed “under-recruited players” such as Stauskas who was a 1st round selection in the 2014 NBA Draft. Maker had been an assistant coach for Beilein at West Virginia from 2005–07. At both Exeter and Williams, Robinson had played in systems that were similar to the one that Beilein runs at Michigan. Robinson asked Maker to contact Beilein who on faith replied that Michigan may have interest at the preferred walk-on level. Robinson was not interested in walk-on consideration given competing scholarship offers. A week later, after seeing video, Beilein said Michigan was considering a scholarship offer. Robinson scheduled visits to Michigan and new Atlantic 10 member Davidson. After the visit to Michigan, Robinson committed to the school. He announced his decision via Twitter on August 6, 2014.</p><p align=justify>During the last weekend of September 2012 while on a campus visit, Division III Williams made Robinson an offer that he accepted immediately. At the time, Williams was ranked the number one liberal arts college in the country according to U.S. News & World Report, and the school was a Division III basketball powerhouse. They had gone 93–22 over the prior four seasons under head coach Mike Maker. In 2013, Robinson led Phillips Exeter Academy to its first NEPSAC Class A championship victory on March 10 against Choate Rosemary Hall with a 24-point, 10-rebound MVP performance. Exeter finished the season at 28–1. Nonetheless, his only scholarship offer was from NCAA Division II’s Merrimack College. He also had interest from Division I Brown Bears and Columbia Lions as well as Division III Bates and Amherst.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duncan Robinson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duncan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duncan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1994</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeffrey Robinson, Elisabeth Robinson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Duncan Robinson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
