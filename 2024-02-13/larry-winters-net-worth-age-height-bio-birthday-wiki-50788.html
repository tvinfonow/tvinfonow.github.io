When Goodhart opened the Ringmasters Wrestling School in Northeast Philadelphia, Larry Winters was hired as head trainer.</p><p>At Autumn Armageddon, Winters took part in a 20-man “reverse cage battle royal” held at Philadelphia’s Penn Hall on September 15.

Feuding with “The Living Legend” Larry Zbyszko, he later earned the same sobriquet which he used for the majority of his career. Other notable opponents included Nick Bockwinkel, Kendo Nagasaki and Jimmy Garvin. His match with Garvin was later released as part of Wrestling’s Greatest Matches series. Winters also took part in tag team as well as singles matches.

Hoping to rekindle their NWF rivalry, Winters was paired against D.C. Drake in a series of wild matches. In their first match together, the brawl reached the balcony level and Winters threw his opponent over the rail and onto the cement floor. Bill Apter, editor of Pro Wrestling Illustrated, wrote the following month that “professional wrestling would be forever changed due to this escalated level of violence”. Indeed, similar TWA feuds between Cactus Jack and Eddie Gilbert, Abdullah the Butcher and The Sheik, and Tony Stetson and Johnny Hotbody were equally violent and, in part, inspired the modern style of “hardcore wrestling” later seen in Extreme Championship Wrestling.</p><h2>Who is Larry Winters Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Larry Winters</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
