He worked with the Buggles, a new wave band formed in London in 1977 with Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes, and Bruce Woolley. Zimmer can be seen briefly in the Buggles’ music video for the 1979 song “Video Killed the Radio Star”. After working with the Buggles, he started to work for the Italian group Krisma, a new wave band formed in 1976 with Maurizio Arcieri and Christina Moser. He was a featured synthesist for Krisma’s third album, Cathode Mamma. He has also worked with the band Helden (with Warren Cann from Ultravox). Both Zimmer (on keyboards) and Cann (on drums), were invited to be part of the Spanish group Mecano for a live performance in Segovia (Spain) in 1984. Two songs from this concert were included in the “Mecano: En Concierto” album released in 1985 only in Spain. In 1985, he contributed to the Shriekback album Oil & Gold. In 1980, Zimmer co-produced a single, “History of the World, Part 1,” with, and for, UK punk band The Damned, which was also included on their 1980 LP release, The Black Album, and carried the description of his efforts as “Over-Produced by Hans Zimmer.”</p><p>While living in London, Zimmer wrote advertising jingles for Air-Edel Associates. In the 1980s, Zimmer partnered with Stanley Myers, a prolific film composer who wrote the scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co–founded the London–based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with electronic instruments. Some of the films on which Zimmer and Myers worked are Moonlighting (1982), Success is the Best Revenge (1984), Insignificance (1985), and My Beautiful Laundrette (1985). Zimmer’s first solo score was Terminal Exposure for director Nico Mastorakis in 1987, for which he also wrote the songs. Zimmer acted as score producer for the 1987 film The Last Emperor, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.</p><p align=justify>From 1982 to 1992, he was married to Vicki Carlin.&nbsp;He married Suzanne Zimmer.&nbsp;He is the father of two daughters, Zoe (Brigitte) and one son, Jake (Jake).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hans Zimmer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hans</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Zimmer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frankfurt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hesse</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Vicki Carolin , Suzanne Zimmer</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Hans Zimmer ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Hollywood director Barry Levinson was looking for someone to score Rain Man, and his wife heard the soundtrack CD of the anti-apartheid drama A World Apart, for which Zimmer had composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer’s work and hired him to score Rain Man. In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers (mostly a Fairlight CMI) mixed with steel drums. Zimmer explained that “It was a road movie, and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. I kept thinking don’t be bigger than the characters. Try to keep it contained. The Raymond character doesn’t actually know where he is. The world is so different to him. He might as well be on Mars. So, why don’t we just invent our own world music for a world that doesn’t really exist?” Zimmer’s score for Rain Man was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, and the film won four Academy Awards including Best Picture.</p><h2>Hans Zimmer Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Hans Zimmer is one of the <strong>richest Composer</strong> from Germany.

Zimmer’s works are notable for integrating electronic music sounds with traditional orchestral arrangements. Since the 1980s, he has composed music for over 150 films.

As a teenager, Zimmer was a fan of Haycock, and their collaboration on film scores includes K2 and Drop Zone. Zimmer wrote the theme for Tony Scott’s 1993 film True Romance, which he based on Carl Orff’s Gassenhauer. Gassenhauer had previously been used in the 1973 film Badlands, which had a similar story of a young man and a girl on the run following a violent crime. The catchy theme, played on nine marimbas, contrasts starkly with the violence of the film.</p><p>For the 1992 film The Power of One, Zimmer traveled to Africa in order to use African choirs and drums in the recording of the score. On the strength of this work, Walt Disney Feature Animation approached Zimmer to compose the score for the 1994 film The Lion King. This was to be his first score for an animated film. Zimmer said that he had wanted to go to South Africa to record parts of the soundtrack, but was unable to visit the country as he had a police record there “for doing ‘subversive’ movies” after his work on The Power of One. Disney studio bosses expressed fears that Zimmer would be killed if he went to South Africa, so the recording of the choirs was organized during a visit by Lebo M. Zimmer won numerous awards for his work on The Lion King, including an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, and two Grammys. In 1997, the score was adapted into a Broadway musical version which won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1998. As of April&nbsp;2012, the musical version of The Lion King is the highest grossing Broadway show of all time, having grossed $853.8 million.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Hans Zimmer height</b> Not available right now.

In an interview with the BBC, Zimmer said: “Going for Gold was a lot of fun. It’s the sort of stuff you do when you don’t have a career yet. God, I just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time.”</p><p align=justify>Zimmer’s score for the 1998 film The Thin Red Line is regarded as one of his most important works. The nine minute cue at the climax of the film, “The Journey to the Line” uses a recurring theme based on four chords, combined with a “ticking clock” motif that has been featured in a range of subsequent scores composed by Zimmer. The piece has been used in numerous trailers and video games, and has earned the nickname “the forbidden cue” due to the tendency of film makers to use it as a temp track for dramatic scenes.</p><h2>Who is Hans Zimmer Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Hans Zimmer</strong> married to <strong>Vicki Carolin , Suzanne Zimmer</strong>.
