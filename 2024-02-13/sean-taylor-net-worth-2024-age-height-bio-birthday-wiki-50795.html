Who is Sean Taylor dating now & how much money does Sean Taylor have?</p><h2>Sean Taylor Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Sean Taylor</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>April 1, 1983</strong> in Miami, Florida, <strong>United States</strong>. Former NFL safety who was selected to two Pro Bowls with the Washington Redskins from 2004 to 2007. He was tragically shot to death in his home in 2007.</p><p>His memory was honored by Redskins coach <a href=#>Joe Gibbs</a>, who sent just 10 players on the field for the first play of the team’s first game following Taylor’s death.</p><p>Taylor played high school football in Pinecrest, a suburb of Miami. He originally began his high school football career at Miami Killian High School, a Class 2A public school, but transferred to Gulliver Preparatory School, a Class prep school, where he was a three-sport star in football, track and basketball. He played both offense and defense. Despite missing the first game of the season (the team’s only loss), he helped Gulliver win the Florida Class 2A State Championship in 2000 with a 14–1 record. Taylor was a star on both sides of the ball during that season, playing running back, defensive back and linebacker. He rushed for 1,400 yards and a state-record 44 touchdowns and on two separate occasions, rushed for more than 200 yards during Gulliver’s state playoff run. He also compiled more than 100 tackles during the season and scored three touchdowns (two receiving, one rushing) in the state title game victory over Marianna High School. In track & field, Taylor won the state 2A 100-meter dash in 2000 and was also one of the state’s top 400-meter dash sprinters. At Gulliver, Taylor was a teammate of future NFL player Buck Ortega. His championship HS team was coached by Steve Howey, Ralph Ortega, Dirk Moran, Lee Horn, Dave Burns, and John McCloskey.</p><p>As a freshman (one of four true freshmen to play for the team), Taylor carved a niche for himself in Miami’s secondary in nickel and dime defensive schemes. During the season, Taylor was named Big East Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance against the Pittsburgh Panthers. The Hurricanes won the national championship in 2001.</p><p align=justify>He was survived by his daughter, Jackie.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sean Taylor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taylor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Miami</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Pedro Taylor, Donna Junor</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gabriel Taylor, Jamal Johnson, Monika Martin, Sasha Johnson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jackie Taylor</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sean Taylor ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Pulled over for driving 82&nbsp;mph on the Beltway, where the speed limit is 55&nbsp;mph, Taylor failed a field sobriety test and then refused a blood alcohol (BAC) test, which resulted in his arrest. A Fairfax County judge acquitted Taylor of the charges in March 2005 after viewing a videotape of Taylor’s roadside sobriety tests that, according to the judge, failed to demonstrate obvious intoxication. Taylor was, however, convicted for refusing to take a blood alcohol test requested by a Virginia state police officer. But when this case was heard on appeal in March 2005, Taylor was acquitted of refusing to take the BAC test, with the judge ruling there was a lack of probable cause for the request.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sean Taylor height</b> <strong>6 feet 3 inches</strong> Sean <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 3 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As a high school player, Taylor led Gulliver Prep to a Florida state championship and rushed for a state record 44 touchdowns in a season.
