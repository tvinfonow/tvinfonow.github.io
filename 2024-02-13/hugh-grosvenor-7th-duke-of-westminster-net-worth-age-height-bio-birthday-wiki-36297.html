Hugh Richard Louis Grosvenor is the third child and only son of Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, and his wife Natalia (née Phillips). Through his mother, he is descended from the Romanov imperial family of Russia and the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin, as well as from the latter’s great-grandfather – African tribal chief turned Russian nobleman Abram Petrovich Hannibal. He was baptised into the Church of England on 23 June 1991. His sisters include Lady Edwina Grosvenor, a prison reformer and philanthropist.</p><p>Little is publicly known about Grosvenor’s personal life, as a result of his family’s efforts to maintain his privacy. However, in October 2013, he was named a godfather to Prince George of Cambridge.</p><p>Upon his father’s death, in August 2016, as well as the peerages, he inherited a wealth then estimated at £9&nbsp;billion, with considerable trust funds for his sisters. This wealth is held in a trust, of which Grosvenor is a beneficial owner but not the legal owner—an arrangement that received considerable press attention, owing to the inheritance tax exemption it confers.</p><p>The Duke and his family are estimated to be worth £10.1 billion (US$13 billion), according to the Sunday Times Rich List in May 2019.
