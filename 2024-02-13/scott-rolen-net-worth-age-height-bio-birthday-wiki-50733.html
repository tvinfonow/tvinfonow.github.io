A seven-time MLB All-Star and 8-time Gold Glove third baseman, who has won the Gold Glove, is recognized for his stints at Philadelphia in addition to St. Louis.</p><p>He took home Eight Gold Glove Awards during his career, which was less than Hall of Fame third-baseman&nbsp;He won eight Gold Glove Awards during his career, eight fewer than Hall-of-Fame third-baseman <a href=#>Brooks Robinson</a>..</p><p>Rolen was born in Evansville, Indiana and attended Jasper High School in Jasper, Indiana. During his senior year at Jasper in 1993, he was named Indiana Mr. Baseball, played tennis, and was the runner-up for Indiana Mr. Basketball. Rolen committed to play college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs over competing offers from programs such as Oklahoma State. However, when Rolen was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1993 MLB Draft, the club increased their bonus offer in order to successfully woo him away from basketball.</p><p>In 1999, Rolen created The Enis Furley Foundation (named after one of Rolen’s dogs), wanting to help children and their families who struggle with illness, hardship, or other special needs. The scope of the foundation was intentionally left broad to give the flexibility to respond to a wide range of personal circumstances. Externally, the Enis Furley Foundation is active in community outreach programs, “Hot Corner Kids”, and the construction of outdoor retreats, such as “Camp Emma Lou” (named after another one of Rolen’s dogs). Rolen’s goals for his charity efforts are simple “To have fun, have a blast. Let’s play.” Rolen gave Indiana University a “major gift” to the Indiana University baseball program and its facility, Bart Kaufman Field. Rolen made the contribution in honor of his parents, Ed and Linda Rolen, who are longtime educators and IU fans.</p><p align=justify>He had a child, Raine and son Finn who was married to Niki.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott Rolen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rolen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Evansville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Indiana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ed Rolen, Linda Rolen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Todd Rolen, Kristie Rolen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Niki Warner</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Raine Tyler Rolen, Finn Edward Rolen</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Scott Rolen ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Only Hall of Famers Brooks Robinson (16) and Mike Schmidt (10) have more at third base. Rolen was supposed to be one of the key pieces in the Phillies revival.

On July 29, 2002, Philadelphia traded Rolen and Doug Nickle to the St. Louis Cardinals for Plácido Polanco, Mike Timlin, and Bud Smith.
