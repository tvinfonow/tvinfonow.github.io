He then went to Kenya to study the social behaviors of baboons in the wild. When the Uganda–Tanzania War broke out in the neighboring countries, Sapolsky decided to travel into Uganda to witness the war up close, later commenting that “I was twenty-one and wanted adventure. […] I was behaving like a late-adolescent male primate.” He went to Uganda’s capital Kampala, and from there to the border with Zaire, and then back to Kampala, witnessing some fighting, including the Ugandan capital’s conquest by the Tanzanian army and its Ugandan rebel allies on 10–11 April 1979. Sapolsky then returned to New York and studied at Rockefeller University, where he received his Ph.D. in neuroendocrinology working in the lab of endocrinologist Bruce McEwen.</p><p>Sapolsky has received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship Genius Grant in 1987, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience. He was also awarded the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the Young Investigator of the Year Awards from the Society for Neuroscience, the International Society for Psychoneuroendocrinology, and the Biological Psychiatry Society.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert Sapolsky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sanford</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wheeler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Researcher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1957</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Thomas Sapolsky</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lisa Sapolsky</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Robert Sapolsky ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Currently, he is working on gene transfer techniques to strengthen neurons against the disabling effects of glucocorticoids. Each year, Sapolsky spends time in Kenya studying a population of wild baboons in order to identify the sources of stress in their environment, and the relationship between personality and patterns of stress-related disease in these animals. More specifically, Sapolsky studies the cortisol levels between the alpha male and female and the subordinates to determine stress level. An early but still relevant example of his studies of olive baboons is to be found in his 1990 Scientific American article, “Stress in the Wild”. He has also written about neurological impairment and the insanity defense within the American legal system.</p><h2>Who is Robert Sapolsky Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Robert Sapolsky</strong> married to <strong>Lisa Sapolsky</strong>.

At the time, stress was mostly ignored as a scientific subject. It was seen as an unpleasant mental state with few long- term consequences.</p><h3>What did Sapolsky identify regarding the stress hormone levels in baboons?</h3><p>Sapolsky has found a key to handling stress may be cultivating friendships. Males who spend the most time grooming and being groomed by females who are not in heat (that is, are not of immediate sexual interest) and playing with infants have the lowest levels of stress hormones.</p><h3>What did Sapolsky discover?</h3><p>Stanford University neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky has been decoding the mysteries of stress by studying baboons from Kenya’s plains, and he discovered that <b>the animal’s rank as a leader or a follower had a direct link to the level of stress hormones in its system</b>.</p>You may read full biography about Robert Sapolsky from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfp7yjsdGtZKyZoKS5tLfYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
