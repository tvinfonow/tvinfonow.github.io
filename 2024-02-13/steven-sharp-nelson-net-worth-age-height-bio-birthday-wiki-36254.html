Nelson. His mother was a former professional opera singer and his younger sister, Camille Nelson, is a folk musician. When he was seven, Nelson’s father decided that each of his children would learn to play an instrument invented before 1800. Nelson tried the violin but discovered a passion for the cello. He studied cello with teacher Kate Reaves and then with Ryan Selberg, the principal cellist for the Utah Symphony. Since his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inhibited his attention span for long practice sessions, he began practicing on other instruments as well, including drums, guitar, and piano. This led to his developing creative ways to play the cello: “strumming it, banging it and using pizzicato much more aggressively – using my thumb, fist, fingernail and palm”. He also began playing with different types of musical groups, including bands, orchestras, and string quartets.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>YouTube Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Piano Guys gained their first widespread exposure with “Michael Meets Mozart” (2011), thanks to Schmidt’s invitation to the nearly 30,000 people on his fan mailing list “to watch it and share it”; as a result, people began watching the videos beyond the region.

In 2009 Anderson saw a YouTube music video that local musician Jon Schmidt had uploaded “for fun”, featuring Schmidt on piano and Nelson on cello and kick drum performing a mashup called “Love Story Meets Viva la Vida”, which combined the Taylor Swift country pop “Love Story” with Coldplay’s Baroque pop “Viva la Vida”. The video garnered over one million hits. Anderson hired the duo to perform on videos that he would professionally film in unusual locations and upload to his store’s YouTube channel.
