The film was a box office success in Germany, grossing US$10.5 million domestically, and Variety, in its review for the film, remarked: “Boasting a gutsy performance from sturdy young German star Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Anatomy is creepy, sometimes gruesome, widescreen fun that pushes all the right buttons. Out-performing Scream at the local [box office] and the biggest German pic of the year so far, this is natural latenight/fantasy fest fare that could become a cult item on half-inch and possibly even theatrically”. Also in 2000, she had the starring role in the romantic drama The Princess and the Warrior, directed by Tykwer, her Run Lola Run director. In the film, she portrayed a psychiatric hospital nurse who, after a near-death experience, enters into a relationship with an anguished former soldier (Benno Fürmann, also her co-star in Anatomy) who lapses into criminality. The independent film was favorably received by critics; eFilmCritic stated that Potente “proves her versatility as an actress here with a much more subdued character, but is still capable of delivering powerhouse emotional scenes”, while the consensus of review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes was: “More slow-moving than Run Lola Run, this film nonetheless offers an intriguing storyline about love and fate”. She received nominations for the European Film Award and the German Film Award for Best Actress.</p><p align=justify>In Che (2008), a two-part biopic about Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, Potente took on the role of communist revolutionary Tamara Bunke. She described the film as “really epic and […] very emotional”, during an interview with Vulture magazine. The film, first screened at the Cannes Film Festival, garnered a positive critical response while it made US$40.9 million worldwide. The New Yorker, pointing out Potente, remarked that “[m]ajor figures come and go, diverting the plot without registering much of an impact”, and The Hollywood Reporter described her part as a “small role” and felt that the actress “seems utterly uncomfortable in every scene”. In 2009, she appeared in the House television series two-part episode “Broken”.</p><h2>Who is Franka Potente Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Franka Potente</strong> married to <strong>Derek Richardson </strong>.
