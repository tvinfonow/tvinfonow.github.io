Blake Was born the 18th of January 1970. He was born in Compton, California.&nbsp;He was heavily influenced by soul and funk artists like Roger Troutman (who even taught him to use the talkbox, which later became the trademark of Quik’s sound during his long professional career) along with George Clinton.&nbsp;In honor of his dear friend, Roger Troutman, he retired the talkbox.&nbsp;David’s interest in music began at age 2, and his mother had a large collection of records.&nbsp;At the age of 12, he had already started playing instruments and, by 21, he was a professional David was a platinum-selling musician.</p><p>After creating buzz about himself on the streets due to the self-made mix tapes he made and mix tapes, he started to garner the attention of various labels such as Profile Records and Ruthless Records.&nbsp;He signed with Profile Records in the summer of 1990, and was reportedly the first signee with a six-figure figure.&nbsp;Quik later on came to be unhappy with his contract to the company and received an increase worth one million dollars from Eazy-E.&nbsp;The situation leaves Profile Records with no other alternative.&nbsp;They began sending emails at Ruthless Records, asking for their cease and desist.</p><p>He later released his second album, titled Way 2 Fonky in 1992. It was certified Gold by October 9. It included the successful singles “Way 2 Fonky” and “Jus Lyke Compton.” The year 1992 would also see him produce (along with Eazy-E) on Paid the Cost, the debut album by rap duo Penthouse Players Clique.</p><p>During that time, Quik was a member to the Tree Top Pirus and Eiht was a member of the 159th St. Tragniew Park Compton Crips. On the track “Def Wish” from CMW’s debut album Straight Checkn ‘Em, it said the line, “Bittin’ me quick, you can get the duck sick quick…” Fans of both artist assumed that to be a diss to Quik. With the mislead feud inbound, Quik respond to CMW’s diss on his song called Way 2 Fonky. CMW responded months later with a music video that featured a DJ Quik lookalike that was being chased by CMW. Quik respond to it as “Let You Have It” and then he was facing label problems and other music projects. However, on the soundtrack to the 1994 short film Murder Was The Case, on the track “Dollaz + Sense”, Quik ruthlessly verbally attacks Eiht, calling him a movie script killer (in reference to Eiht’s appearance in the critically acclaimed 1993 film Menace II Society), a coward, and more. Quik furthered the flames by performing the song at the 1995 Source Awards in New York City. The feud stayed quiet until April 1996, where Eiht responded to Quik on his sophomore solo album Death Threatz. The feud between Quik and Eiht slowly faded in 1997 following the deaths of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., but the feud didn’t actually end until the summer of 2002, where Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and other West Coast rappers helped Eiht and Quik squash the beef. Since then, Quik and Eiht collaborated on various songs. Even though the rivalry was not on the level of the Nas-Jay Z rivalry or the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry since it was not covered by the media, it has been hailed by most hip hop fans and critics that it stands out as one of the longest active hip hop rivalries of all time (from 1992 to 1998).</p><p align=justify>When DJ Quik began to work on his third album DJ Quik began working with Suge Knight once more.&nbsp;Their collaboration started in 1988 before he sought refuge at an important label.&nbsp;He was signed by Suge’s own record label Funky Enough Records in 1988.&nbsp;The deal was not long-lasting.&nbsp;The two groups reunited in 1993 for a second brief arrangement.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>DJ Quik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>DJ</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Quik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Compton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Alicia Hill</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>David Blake, Jr, Davieanna Marlena Blake</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>DJ Quik ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
