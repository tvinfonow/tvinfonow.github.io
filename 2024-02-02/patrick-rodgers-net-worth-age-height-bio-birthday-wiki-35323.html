From April through July, however, his form dipped as he made only six of 12 cuts and did not record a finish higher than T31. He nearly won the Travelers Championship in August, finishing T3, two shots behind the champion, Russell Knox. Having qualified for the FedExCup Playoffs for the first time in his career, he was eliminated after the second playoff event, the Deutsche Bank Championship, and ended 2016 ranked 62nd in the season-long standings.</p><h2>Patrick Rodgers Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Patrick Rodgers is one of the <strong>richest Golfer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Patrick Rodgers</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Patrick Rodgers (born June 30, 1992) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Golfer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As of 2017, Rodgers has been in a relationship with Jade Olivia Gordon, who is a British stunt coordinator and film assistant. The two became engaged on December 28, 2017 and married on May 26, 2019 at the Vizcaya Museum & Gardens in Miami, Florida. They currently reside together in a home they purchased in Jupiter, Florida.</p><p>The 2017 season began significantly worse for Rodgers than the 2016 season had. He missed the cut in five of his first eight tournaments, sandwiching top-10 finishes in the RSM Classic (T10) and the Farmers Insurance Open (T4) between early weekend exits. He shared the 54-hole lead at the Farmers with Brandt Snedeker, but shot a lackluster even-par 72 in the final round to finish four shots behind eventual champion Jon Rahm. Seven missed cuts in eight events followed, and Rodgers plummeted from 43rd in the FedExCup standings in January to 114th by June. Out of nowhere, Rodgers led the John Deere Classic by two strokes entering the final round. He appeared on his way to his first PGA Tour victory, going 3-under through 13 holes in the final round. He played the last five holes 1-over, however, opening the door for Bryson DeChambeau to claim the tournament with a back-nine 30 and a 15-foot birdie on the final green. Despite the heartbreaking finish, Rodgers recorded his career-best finish on the PGA Tour and earned enough FedExCup points to assure he would keep his card for the 2017-18 season.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Patrick Rodgers height</b> <strong>6′ 2″</strong> Paul <strong>weight</strong> <strong>84&nbsp;kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6′ 2″</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>84&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Rodgers earned “Special Temporary Member” status on the PGA Tour for 2015 after finishing T40 at the Memorial Tournament. He later finished 24th on the 2015 Web.com Tour money list, earning a PGA Tour card for the 2015–16 season. Even with the finish, he was not allowed to compete in the 2015 Web.com Tour Finals since he also accumulated enough FedEx Cup points to place inside the Top 125. He also could not compete in the 2015 FedEx Cup because Special Temporary Membership does not qualify a player for the FedExCup Playoffs; had he won a PGA Tour tournament, he would have earned full membership and become eligible for the playoffs. He appeared on EA Sports’ Rory McIlroy PGA Tour game as a new golfer in 2015.</p><h2>Who is Patrick Rodgers Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Patrick Rodgers</strong> married to <strong>Jade Gordon </strong>.
