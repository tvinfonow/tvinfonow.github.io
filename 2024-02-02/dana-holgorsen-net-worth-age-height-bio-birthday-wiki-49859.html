Who is Dana Holgorsen dating now & how much money does Dana Holgorsen have?</p><h2>Dana Holgorsen Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Dana Holgorsen</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Football Coach</strong> who was born on <strong>June 21, 1971</strong> in Davenport, Iowa, <strong>United States</strong>. His coaching journey began in 1993 as a position head coach for Valdosta State, and made his debut as head coach in 2011 at West Virginia University.</p><p>In his debut season at West Virginia He was a quarterback coach at West Virginia.&nbsp;In his first year at West Virginia he coached quarterback <a href=#>Geno Smith</a>..</p><p>Houston had long been known for high-scoring offenses, from the Veer, which tallied 100 points in one game, to the Run and Shoot of the late 1980s, which set numerous college football records. As the Offensive Coordinator at the University of Houston, Dana Holgorsen gained prominence and recognition as one of the most promising, up-and-coming offensive coaches in the country, and his success running the Cougar offense would set the table for future coaching opportunities. During his two-year tenure with the Cougars, Holgorsen’s offenses accounted for 563 yards of total offense per game, including 433.7 yards passing, and averaging 42.2 points per game. His offense ranked No. 3 in total offense in 2008 with a duo of freshmen quarterbacks and No. 1 in 2009 behind the arm of Heisman finalist and All-Conference quarterback Case Keenum. In 2008–2009, quarterback Case Keenum led the nation in total offense, averaging 403.2 yards per game as a sophomore and 416.4 yards his junior season. He also ranked among the top 10 nationally in pass efficiency both years. Under Holgorsen’s tutelage, Case Keenum would go on to become college football’s all-time leading passer in yards gained and touchdowns. At Houston, Holgorsen demonstrated his own brand of the Air Raid offense that often used motion to confuse opposing defenses, as well as wearing them down. In 2009, Holgorsen developed a set called the “diamond formation,” which features multiple diverging running backs in the backfield who use spread formations to gain yards after catching short passes. Houston’s fast wide receivers were ideal to the style of spread Holgorsen ran, and Houston continued using much the same offense after Holgorsen departed to lead the NCAA with over 50 points per game, and 600 yards of offense per game in 2011. At Houston, Holgorsen mentored not only Case Keenum but offensive coaches including Kliff Kingsbury and Jason Phillips, who continued running a Holgorsen-inspired Air Raid offense at Houston.</p><p>Holgorsen is a native of Mount Pleasant, Iowa where he graduated from Mount Pleasant Community High School in 1989. Holgorsen played wide receiver at Iowa Wesleyan College, earning a degree in 1993 and a master’s in health and physical education from Valdosta State University in 1995. Holgorsen had been recruited to Iowa Wesleyan by head coach Hal Mumme and offensive coordinator Mike Leach, both of whom he coached with later in their careers.</p><p align=justify>He had three children with Candice Holgorsen. They divorced in 2005.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dana Holgorsen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Holgorsen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1971</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Davenport</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Iowa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Candice Holgorsen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Logan Holgorsen, Karlyn Holgorsen, McClayne Holgorsen</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dana Holgorsen ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
