Scrappy and well-rounded NBA point guard who was selected 24th overall in the 2006 NBA Draft by the Memphis Grizzlies after two stellar seasons at Villanova. He played for the Rockets from 2009 to 2012 before a trade sent him to the Toronto Raptors. He was named to his first NBA All-Star game in 2015 and in 2019, he helped the Raptors win the NBA Championship.</p><p>At Villanova, he was teammates with fellow guard and future first round selection <a href=#>Randy Foye</a>.</p><p>Lowry entered the playoffs suffering from bursitis in his shooting elbow, as he shot a mere 32% from the field over the final 10 games of the regular season. His poor shooting continued into the postseason as the Raptors faced the Indiana Pacers in the first round. Despite Lowry’s struggles, the Raptors defeated the Pacers in seven games, winning their second playoff series in franchise history, their first since 2001, and their first seven-game series. In Game 3 of the Raptors’ second-round series against the Miami Heat, Lowry broke out of his shooting slump with a 33-point performance on 11-of-19 shooting, helping the Raptors win 95–91 and go up 2–1 on the series. In Game 6 of the series, he tied his playoff career high with 36 points on 12-of-27 shooting in a 103–91 loss, as the Heat forced a Game 7 in Toronto. In Game 7 of the series, he scored 35 points on 11-of-20 shooting, to go along with nine assists, seven rebounds, and four steals, in a 116–89 win, helping the Raptors advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history. In Game 4 of the Conference Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lowry scored 35 points on 14-of-20 shooting to help the Raptors win 105–99 and tie the series at 2–2. In Game 6 of the series, Lowry again scored 35 points, but was unable to force a Game 7, with the 113–87 loss knocking the Raptors out of the playoffs with a 4–2 defeat. Lowry capped off his strong season by earning All-NBA third team honors. With his first selection to the All-NBA team, he joined Vince Carter and Chris Bosh as the only players in franchise history to receive this recognition.</p><p>Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was listed as the No. 6 point guard and the No. 28 player in the U.S. in 2004.</p><p align=justify>He was raised with a younger brother named Lonnie.
