By May 1987 Wilson had left Harem Scarem, he joined Kelly’s 45-date tour of North America promoting Gossip. Wilson acknowledged Kelly for extending his repertoire beyond harmonica, “I was asked on as a sax player too and I didn’t play all that much sax when [Kelly] asked. But he had that faith in me that I’d get my act together.” During that year Wilson also guested on the Hunters & Collectors’ album What’s a Few Men? (November 1987), on Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls’ next album, Under the Sun (December), and played with hard rockers X.</p><p>In September of the following year Wilson, on harmonica and saxophone, and Barry Palmer on lead guitar, joined a neo-Blues group, Harem Scarem, alongside Peter Jones on drums, Charles Marshall on guitar, Christopher Marshall on lead vocals and Glen Sheldon on bass guitar.

The album was produced by Wilson and Waters with Chris Thompson. McFarlane described it as a “more fully realised work than the debut.

It contained Wilson’s composition “The Ballad of Slim Boy Fat”, which was a “highlight” of the album with its “spectacular blues/gospel” style.

Stuart Coupe of The Canberra Times described the group’s sound as “a diverse amalgam, recalling everything from Tim Buckley to Captain Beefheart and American blues”. While Wilson felt his group was not only a blues band as “there’s elements of country and straight rock ‘n’ roll”. Their debut release was a six-track extended play, Gnawing on the Bones of Elvis, which was produced by the band and appeared in April 1988. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted it was “sparsely recorded … [which] mixed one side of electric blues including Willie Dixon’s ‘Bring It on Home’, and one side of acoustic folk tunes”.</p><p align=justify>At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993, held in April, Wilson was nominated for Best Male Artist and Breakthrough Artist – Album for Landlocked. In June of that year Wilson, Charlie Owen, and three former members of The Triffids: David McComb, Robert McComb and Graham Lee guested on Acuff’s Rose’s debut studio album, Never Comin’ Down.

Boehm described Wilson as “a big, denim-clad slab of a man with a shaven head and the look of a street tough or a stevedore. In contrast to such reserved performers as Kelly … he had a taste for the monumental. His big, rangy, high-impact voice supported his flair for the dramatic flourish and the grand gesture”. As a performer Wilson showed “a dry, laconic wit between songs, [he] was a fervent, let-it-all-out wailer when he began to sing”.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Chris Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular MMA Fighter</strong>.
