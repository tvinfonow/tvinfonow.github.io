According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Rich Piana</b>'s net worth <strong>$4 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>When he was 11, he began his training to be a bodybuilder.</p><p align=justify>He was a part of television series such as Ripley’s Believe It or Not and NBC’s Scrubs.&nbsp;He was the lead role in Tim Muriello and Rich Piana Interviews, as well as Mutant: Leaving humanity Behind.&nbsp;He was open about his use steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs.</p><p align=justify>Piana was born in Glendale, California, on September 26, 1970. His ancestry was Armenian (through his mother) and Italian (through his father). Raised in Sacramento, California, his enthrallment with bodybuilding began when he was six. He would go to the gym to watch his mother train for her bodybuilding contests. Alongside her, Piana was also heavily influenced by Bill Cambra, an “old-school” bodybuilder. At age 11, Piana began weightlifting. Four years later, he started competing in bodybuilding contests. For his senior year in high school, he lived with his father in La Crescenta, California. By the age of 18, Piana already had several titles under his belt, including IFBB Mr. Teen California in 1989, and had started on a common steroid cycle practice known as “test and deca” that combines testosterone (an anabolic steroid that is the primary male sex hormone) and Deca-Durabolin (known generically as Nandrolone).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bodybuilder</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In another video in 2016, he backed up his decision but advised viewers not to use the drugs, stating, “If you have the choice to do steroids or stay natural, stay natural. There’s no reason to do steroids. You’re only hurting your body and hurting yourself.” He then said that professional bodybuilders have no such choice, since they cannot win at that level without using the drugs. He said, “I was competing on stage and I was getting to the point where I was going to keep getting blown off the stage if I didn’t do them. So I took that step and that’s the road I chose, and here I am.”</p><p>After spending two weeks in an induced coma to try and reduce swelling to the brain, Piana died on August 25, 2017, at the age of 46. An autopsy revealed “significant heart disease” and that his heart and liver weighed over twice the average amount for an adult male. Jansen said Piana was well aware that his organs were enlarged, and that this was a known side effect of the steroids and hormones he had been taking, but said he was not aware that this put him at risk for a sudden cardiac arrest.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Rich Piana height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Rich <strong>weight</strong> <strong>101 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>101 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In a 2014 YouTube video, he said that he had used anabolic steroids over the course of 25 years – since he was 18 years old – and specifically stated that everyone should be aware that using steroids will do damage to their body, but also said that he was willing to take the chance. He said he had experienced some side effects, such as hair loss, gynecomastia (enlarged breasts, which he had treated with medication), and signs of liver toxicity, but said he had not had acne or major problems thus far. However, he said: “I am totally 100% aware that damage is being done to my body by the choices I am making”, that “I know for a fact that doing what I am doing is going to cause damage”, but also said: “I have made a choice and I am willing to deal with that – I am willing to take those chances”.</p><p align=justify>He had a cameo appearance as The Incredible Hulk in an episode of the television series Scrubs, and played an oiled-up muscle man named Marcus in an episode of “Malcolm in the Middle” (without any spoken lines).

He was standing at the time and hit his head when he collapsed. Jansen called the 911 emergency operator, and followed their instructions to try to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived about 10 minutes into her call. The paramedics confirmed that his heart was not beating properly. His heartbeat was eventually restored, but only after so much time had passed that brain damage had set in from lack of oxygen. After the discovery of crushed white powder along with a straw and a credit card on the table in his home, paramedics administered Narcan, a medication used to counteract a possible opiate overdose. There was later speculation about possible recreational drug use, foul play, or other unknown factors involved in his death. However, Jansen denied that cocaine, heroin, or other drugs were involved – saying he had sometimes snorted a high-caffeine pre-workout supplement and that he did not use recreational drugs. Twenty bottles of testosterone were reportedly found in his home.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Rich Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Bodybuilder</strong>.
