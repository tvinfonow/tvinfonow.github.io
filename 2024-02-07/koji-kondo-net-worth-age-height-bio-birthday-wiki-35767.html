Composer of soundtracks for classic Nintendo video games, including the “Super Mario” and “The Legend of Zelda” series.</p><p>He called <a href=#>Ian Gillan</a>‘s “Deep Purple” one of his musical influences.</p><p>Koji Kondo (Japanese: 近藤 浩治 , Hepburn: Kondō Kōji, born August 13, 1961) is a Japanese music composer, pianist, and sound director who works for the video game company Nintendo. He is best known for his involvement in numerous contributions in the Mario and The Legend of Zelda series of video games, among others produced by the company. Kondo was hired by Nintendo in 1984, becoming the first person hired by them to specialize in musical composition for video games. Shortly after, Kondo was assigned as the sound designer on the 1985 game Super Mario Bros. His sound design for the game, especially the overworld theme, has often been cited as among the most memorable in video game history.</p><p>Even before officially joining Nintendo, his first product is the audio for Nintendo’s arcade game Punch-Out!! (1984). By creating mostly jingles and sound effects, he was able to overcome the challenges of early arcade sound hardware. As the Famicom had become highly popular in Japan since its 1983 launch, Kondo was assigned to compose music for the console’s subsequent games at Nintendo’s new development team, Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD). His second Nintendo product is the instruction manual on how to program Japanese popular music into the Famicom using the peripheral Family BASIC. To conclude his first year at Nintendo, he created some of the music of Devil World, alongside Akito Nakatsuka. In 1985, Nintendo started marketing the Famicom abroad as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to capitalize on the 1983 video game crash that had devastated Atari, Inc. and other companies. He composed the music for the hit releases Super Mario Bros. (1985) and The Legend of Zelda (1986), of which 60 million copies were sold in total and which established some of the most well-known melodies in the video game industry.</p><p align=justify>His family was residing in Nagoya, Japan, when he was born.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Koji Kondo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Koji</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kondo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nagoya</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Koji Kondo ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Super Mario Bros., for many years the best-selling video game of all time for a single platform, is Kondo’s first major score. The game’s melodies were created with the intention that short segments of music could be endlessly repeated during the same gameplay without causing boredom. Kondo’s soundtrack to Super Mario Bros. gained worldwide recognition, and is the most well-known video game score in history. The main theme is iconic in popular culture and has been featured in more than 50 concerts, been a best-selling ringtone, and been remixed or sampled by various musicians. Kondo’s work on The Legend of Zelda scores has also become highly recognized. He produced four main pieces of background music for the first installment of the series; the overworld theme has become comparable in popularity with the Super Mario Bros. main theme. After the success of The Legend of Zelda, he provided the score for two Japanese-exclusive games, The Mysterious Murasame Castle (1986) and Shin Onigashima (1987). He created the soundtrack to Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic (1987), which was later rebranded outside Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2 in 1988.</p><h2>Koji Kondo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Koji Kondo is one of the <strong>richest Composer</strong> from Japan.

Koichi Sugiyama directed a jazz arrangement album of Super Mario World’ s music and oversaw its performance at the first Orchestral Game Music Concert in 1991. After finishing the soundtrack to Super Mario World, Kondo was in charge of the sound programming for Pilotwings (1990), while also composing the “Helicopter Theme” for it, and created the sound effects for Star Fox (1993). In 1995, he composed for the sequel to Super Mario World, Yoshi’s Island. Until the early 2000s, Kondo would usually write all compositions by himself on a project, with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time’s being the last one Kondo worked on alone. Since then, he has been collaborating with other staff members at Nintendo, advising and supervising music created by others, as well as providing additional compositions for games, including Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and Super Mario 3D World. He also served as the sound director and lead composer of Super Mario Maker and its sequel, Super Mario Maker 2.</p><p>Kondo attended the world premiere of Play! A Video Game Symphony at the Rosemont Theater in Rosemont, Illinois in May 2006, where his music from the Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda series was performed by a full symphony orchestra. He also attended and performed in a series of three concerts celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series in late 2011. He performed piano with the American rock band Imagine Dragons live at The Game Awards 2014 ceremony in December 2014.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Koji Kondo height</b> Not available right now.

He successfully applied for the job without requiring any demo tapes. He recalls, “I found my way to Nintendo by looking at the school’s job placement board. You’re supposed to apply to many different companies, but I saw the Nintendo ad, and had a love of making synthesizers, and loved games, and thought – that’s the place for me. I interviewed with one company, Nintendo, and that’s where I’ve been ever since.” Kondo is the third person hired by Nintendo to create music and sound effects for its games, joining Hirokazu Tanaka and Yukio Kaneoka. However, he is the first at Nintendo to actually specialize in musical composition.</p><h2>Who is Koji Kondo Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Koji Kondo</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
