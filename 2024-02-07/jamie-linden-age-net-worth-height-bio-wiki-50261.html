After reading in a 30th anniversary article in FSView & Florida Flambeau, Florida State’s student newspaper, about the 1970 Southern Airways Flight 932 plane crash that killed most of the Marshall University football team, Linden says he became “obsessed” with the story. After moving to Hollywood, his first job involved reading feature film screenplays. After being fired from several assistant positions, he decided to write his own screenplay. His first script was titled Things to Do Before I Die, co-written with University of Florida alumnus Cory Helms, and Warner Bros. gave the pair a blind deal to write another script. Linden says the aftermath of the Marshall University tragedy was the very first story he ever thought of. In 2004, he pitched the story to Warner Bros. with film producers Basil Iwanyk and Mary Viola. When Warner Bros. bought the script, Linden and other film crew met with many family members of the plane crash victims including Keith Morehouse, whose father was killed in the crash, to collaborate on the honesty of the script and the dignity of the victims. The film became We Are Marshall, released in 2006 and directed by Joseph McGinty Nichol.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Screenwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2018, Linden had a son with girlfriend Rachel McAdams.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jamie Linden height</b> Not available right now.
