Who is Bobby Meacham dating now & how much money does Bobby Meacham have?</p><h2>Bobby Meacham Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Bobby Meacham</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Baseball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>August 25, 1960</strong> in Los Angeles, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Robert Andrew Meacham (born August 25 60, 1960) is an Major League Baseball coach and an ex-player.&nbsp;His main position of play was shortstop, and he played the entirety of his career playing for the New York Yankees.&nbsp;He is currently a trainer for Philadelphia Phillies. Philadelphia Phillies.</p><p>In the off season during the off season, the Yankees bought Tim Foli to play short in 1984.&nbsp;The Yankees had a bit of a revolving door in short and short, including Meacham, Foli, Roy Smalley and Andre Robertson all seeing playing time at the position.&nbsp;Meacham was the one to get the most playing time among the group having played 840 innings and hitting .253 and registering two home RBIs and 25 runs.&nbsp;In spite of his small role, Meacham led the American League with 14 sacrifice hits during the entire season.&nbsp;Meacham served as an Yankees regular shortstop in the year 1985 and played in 156 (162) games.&nbsp;He batted just .218 in 1985 but was the top player in Major Leagues in sacrifice hits with 23.</p><p>Meacham and his wife, Gari, have three children. The Meachams gained notoriety in 1985 when Yankees manager Billy Martin and owner George Steinbrenner attempted to refuse to give Meacham a day off to witness the birth of his first child.</p><p>The most notable play of Meacham’s career was a bizarre baserunning gaffe which also involved Dale Berra in an 11-inning 6–5 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium on August 2, 1985. With Meacham and Berra the runners at second and first base respectively in the seventh inning of a game tied at three, Rickey Henderson hit a ball that rolled to the farthest reaches of left-center field. When Meacham slipped between second and third base, both runners ended up approaching home plate in synchronized fashion, one on the heels of the other. After catching the relay throw from shortstop Ozzie Guillén, catcher Carlton Fisk tagged out Meacham to his right, then turned to his left just a split second later to do the same to Berra to complete the double play. Yankees manager Billy Martin commented, “I’ve never seen that in grammar school, much less a major-league game.”</p><p align=justify>Meacham was a mediocre hitter, batting only .182 in his team, the Gastonia Cardinals of the South Atlantic League in 1981.&nbsp;His average of batting grew by .259 in 1982, when he was with the Florida State League’s St. Petersburg Cardinals, however, Meacham’s .915 percent fielding rate and 47 mistakes were significantly worse than the team which employed Ozzie Smith as short.&nbsp;On the 14th of December of 1982, he transferred with the New York Yankees with OF Stan Javier for P Marty Mason and Steve Fincher, P Steve Fincher and OF Bob Helsom in an agreement for minor leagues.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bobby Meacham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bobby</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Meacham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gari Meacham</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Colton Meacham, Alexandra Meacham, Brooke Meacham</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bobby Meacham ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was particularly frustrated with Meacham’s injuries and lackluster play and often lambasted him in the New York press. Following the 1988 season, Meacham was traded to the Texas Rangers for Bob Brower.</p><h2>Bobby Meacham Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Bobby Meacham is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Bobby Meacham</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Meacham was originally selected in the Chicago White Sox out of Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California in the 14th round of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft, but he decided instead for a baseball career on the campus of San Diego State University.</p><p align=justify>He was awarded third-team All-America distinction when he was a freshman as well as being awarded the San Diego State Aztecs team MVP in 1979.&nbsp;He was a second-team All-American in 1981, after batting .375 which included seven home runs as well as 51 runs batted in as well as 44 bases stolen and was picked for the St. Louis Cardinals with the eighth overall selection at the time of the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft.&nbsp;He signed his contract, ending his SDSU career as the all-time leading player in runs (214) as well as the number of hits (277) in at bats (767) as well as second in steal bases (116) with thirty consecutive streaks.</p><p align=justify>This turned out to be a very good deal for the Yankees, as none of the three players the Yankees sent to the Cardinals ever reached the majors, and Javier was later included in the December 5, 1984 deal to acquire Rickey Henderson from the Oakland Athletics. Meacham, meanwhile, earned a major league promotion by June of his first season with his new club. He made his Major League debut on June 30 in the 12th inning of an extra innings game against the Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees won on a Butch Wynegar walk off home run before Meacham could log his first major league at bat. That did not occur until his third major league game against the Seattle Mariners on September 3, 1983. He lined out to Mariners third baseman Manny Castillo. By the end of the season, Meacham had won the Yankees’ starting shortstop job, appearing in a total of 22 games, and batting .235 in 51 at bats.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Meacham failed to make the Rangers out of Spring training 1989, and was released by the club. He joined the Pittsburgh Pirates shortly afterwards, spending all of the 1989 season with their triple A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons, but never reaching the major league level. He spent 1990 with the Omaha Royals, but again failed to make the major league club, however, following his retirement as a player, Meacham received his first minor league coaching job from the Kansas City Royals.</p><p>After serving as a minor league coach with the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1994 to 2001, Meacham was given his first managerial job in 2002 with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes (advanced A California League affiliate of the Anaheim Angels). He held that job through 2004, and returned to the Rockies organization in 2005 as their Minor League roving infield instructor. The following season, he received his first major league coaching job, when new Florida Marlins manager Joe Girardi named him third base coach in 2006.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bobby Meacham height</b> Not available right now.

Meacham ended up splitting 1986 and 1987 between the Yankees and their triple A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. He spent all of 1988 with the big league club, but injuries and the off season acquisition of Rafael Santana from the New York Mets limited Meacham to only 47 games, during which, he saw about half his playing time at second base.</p><p align=justify>On August 19, 2012, Meacham was released from the Houston Astros, along with Manager Brad Mills and hitting coach Mike Barnett.</p><h2>Who is Bobby Meacham Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Bobby Meacham</strong> married to <strong>Gari Meacham</strong>.
