Foss have?</p><h2>Karen A. Foss Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Karen A. Foss</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Educator</strong> who was born on <strong>January 26, 1950</strong> in Portland, Oregon, <strong>United States</strong>. Karen Foss and her twin sister, Sonja K. Foss who is also a rhetorical scholar and teacher in communication They were born in Portland, Oregon, on the 26th of January, 1950 and then grew up within Eugene, Oregon.&nbsp;Foss received her B.A.&nbsp;with a major in Romance Languages (Spanish and French) at the University of Oregon in 1972 and an M.A.&nbsp;in Speech (Rhetoric and Public Address) from the University of Oregon in 1973 as well as an Ph.D. in Speech and Dramatic Art (Rhetoric and Public Address) from the University of Iowa in 1976.&nbsp;The school she taught was Humboldt State University (1976-1993) as well as the University of New Mexico (1993-2015) and is currently Regents professor emeritus.&nbsp;She was the Director of Women Studies from 1978-1980 and 1989-1992 at Humboldt State University and from 1995 to 1997 from 1995 to 1997 at the University of New Mexico.&nbsp;She was also department chair for Communication & Journalism at the University of New Mexico from 1997 to 2000 and from 2013 to 2015.&nbsp;She was an associate professor visiting of the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1984 to 1985 and was an senior specialist Fulbright scholar at the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, in March 2007.</p><p>Foss’s most recent research has been on the ways feminist perspectives can change the field of communication.&nbsp;She aims to develop and transform theories to offer an expanded toolkit for communicators that does not depend solely on the speech practices of elite white males.&nbsp;Her argument is stated in “Transforming Rhetoric through Female Reconstruction as a Response to the Gender Diversity Perspective” (with Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin). She also outlined the field of communication, in feminist rhetorical theories (with Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin) and evidence of alternative theories which emerged from the thought and actions of feminist thinkers like Sally Miller Gearhart, Gloria Anzaldua bell hooks along with Sonia Johnson. Inviting Transformation Communication for a New World (with Sonja K. Foss) is another example of her efforts to rethink the way we think about public speaking. Foss and Foss present a fresh model for public speaking, which incorporates the principles of invitational rhetoric, as well as speech practices of the marginalized. With Gender Stories (with Sonja K. Foss and Mary E. Domenico), Foss reconsiders gender, sex and feminism as constructs of social society. Foss also juxtaposes the concept of persuasion — the predominant view of change within the discipline–with an alternative view derived from different disciplines and tradition.</p><p align=justify>Certain of Foss’s works provide brief overviews of rhetorical and communications theories.&nbsp;Current perspectives on Rhetoric (with Sonja K. Foss and Robert Trapp) summarizes the theories of 10 rhetorical theorists comprising Kenneth Burke, bell hooks, Jean Baudrillard, and Michel Foucault.&nbsp;Theories of Human Communication, now in its 11th edition, outlines theories from the field of communication.&nbsp;Foss as well as Stephen W. Littlejohn also co-authored, in 2009 The Encyclopedia of Communication Theory, which is a set of two volumes that covers theories, concepts, and applications of the theories of communication.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Karen A.

Foss).&nbsp;She also contributed to the study of social movements by women within the field, illustrated through her essays on the Sapir-Whorf theory of the current women’s movement (with Michael J.
