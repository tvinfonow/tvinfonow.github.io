She played Ginny, a temperamental housewife having an affair with a lifeguard (Justin Timberlake). She described Ginny as permanently dissatisfied and uneasy, and playing her proved difficult for Winslet, who suffered from anxiety. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times disliked Allen’s writing but credited Winslet for filling her “shabby character with feverish life”. When asked about her decision to work with Allen despite an allegation of child sexual abuse against him, Winslet chose not to comment on Allen’s personal life but said she was pleased with the collaboration. In 2019, Winslet provided her voice to Moominvalley, an animated television series about the Moomins. She next took on a leading role alongside Susan Sarandon and Mia Wasikowska in Blackbird, a remake of the Danish film Silent Heart (2014).

She did not earn much from the job, and at 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen.

The New Zealand-based production is based on the Parker–Hulme murder case of 1954, in which Winslet played Juliet Hulme, a teenager who assists her friend, Pauline Parker (played by Melanie Lynskey), in the murder of Pauline’s mother. She prepared for the part by reading the transcripts of the girls’ murder trial, their letters and diaries, and interacted with their acquaintances. She has said that she learnt tremendously from the job. Jackson filmed in the real murder locations, and the experience left Winslet traumatised. She found it difficult to detach herself from her character, and said that after returning home, she often cried. The film was a critical breakthrough for Winslet; The Washington Post writer Desson Thomson called her “a bright-eyed ball of fire, lighting up every scene she’s in”. Winslet recorded “Juliet’s Aria” for the film’s soundtrack. Also that year, she appeared as Geraldine Barclay, a prospective secretary, in the Royal Exchange Theatre production of Joe Orton’s farce What the Butler Saw.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Kate Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actress</strong>.

Impressed by her reading, Thompson cast her for the much larger part of the recklessly romantic teenager Marianne Dashwood. The director Ang Lee wanted Winslet to play the part with grace and restraint—aspects that he felt were missing from her performance in Heavenly Creatures—and thus asked her to practice tai chi, read gothic literature, and learn to play the piano. David Parkinson of the Radio Times found Winslet to be a standout among the ensemble cast, and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle took note of how well she had portrayed her character’s growth and maturity. The film grossed over US$134&nbsp;million worldwide. She won the Screen Actors Guild and British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, and received nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in the same category. Also in 1995, Winslet featured in the poorly received Disney film A Kid in King Arthur’s Court.</p><h3>How old was Kate in Titanic?</h3><p>46&nbsp;years (October 5, 1975)</p><h3>How old was Kate Winslet when she made Titanic?</h3><p>Winslet, <b>46</b>, and DiCaprio, 47, have known each other since they were in their early twenties and launched into mega stardom by “Titanic.” “I turned 21 on that shoot, and Leo turned 22,” she told The Guardian.
