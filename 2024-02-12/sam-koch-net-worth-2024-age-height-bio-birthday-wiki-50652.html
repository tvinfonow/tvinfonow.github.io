NFL punter who established records in the league for the longest punt distance, longest distance and the highest standard yards of team Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Tight finish&nbsp;Tight end <a href=#>Ed Dickson</a> became his teammate in 2010 and also contributed to the team’s Super Bowl XLVII win.&nbsp;became his teammate in the year 2010 and played a role in the team’s victory in Super Bowl XLVII.</p><p>Koch walked on to the Nebraska football team, where he played punter, and later would receive a scholarship before the start of the 2004 season. He did not see game action as a redshirt freshman in 2002, but served as the backup punter. As a sophomore in 2003, he backed up Kyle Larson at punter, but did not attempt a punt. Koch was Nebraska’s punter from 2004–05 after holding kickoff duties for 7 games in 2003. He was named to the 2005 2nd-team Academic All-Big 12 squad and the 2005 Big 12 Commissioner’s Spring and Fall Academic Honor Roll. He racked up a career-punting average of 44.1 yards (with 56 kicks inside the 20 and a long of 84 yards). As a senior, Koch put together the best campaign ever at his position in school history, as he broke the single-season punting average mark with a 46.5-yard average in 2005. The 2005 average bested the previous record of 45.1 yards per punt by former Bengals punter Kyle Larson in 2003. Koch’s average ranked second nationally and helped Nebraska to a No. 2 national ranking in net punting (39.9 avg.) As a senior, was a semifinalist for the Ray Guy Award. In his collegiate finale in the 2005 Alamo Bowl , Koch posted a 51.5-yard average on 8 punts against Michigan, including 5 punts over 50 yards each. He connected on at least 1 punt of 50 yards or more in 8 of 11 contests and surpassed the 48-yard barrier in every single game. He was the Huskers’ kickoff specialist for the 2nd half of the season and 18 of his 32 kickoffs resulted in touchbacks. In his final 6 games, opponents had just 10 returns totaling 165 yards. In December 2005, he earned a degree in business administration.</p><p>Koch was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round (203rd overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he played in all 16 regular season games, punting 86 times for 3,695 yards and placing 30 of those inside the 20 which ranked fourth in the NFL.
