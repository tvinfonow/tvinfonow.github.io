Who is Disappearance of Kristin Smart dating now & how much money does Disappearance of Kristin Smart have?</p><h2>Disappearance of Kristin Smart Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Disappearance of Kristin Smart</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Celebrity</strong> who was born on <strong>February 20, 1977</strong> in Augsburg, <strong>Germany</strong>. Kristin Denise Smart was born February 20, 1977, in Augsburg, Germany, to Stan and Denise Smart, both teachers. She had one brother and one sister. Smart’s family relocated to the United States during her childhood, where she was raised in Stockton, California.</p><p>Smart was declared legally dead on May 25, 2002, the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Her parents, Denise and Stan Smart, took a civil case of wrongful death against Flores, one of the three students who walked Smart to her dorm, in 2005. Flores has denied any involvement in the disappearance. The Flores family had also filed a lawsuit against the Smart family for emotional distress.</p><p>On September 6, 2016, officials from the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff’s Office announced they were investigating a new lead in the case. Cadaver dogs from the FBI were brought in and investigators were preparing to spend approximately four days excavating an area on the Cal Poly campus. After three days, items were found at all three dig sites located on the same hillside near Smart’s dorm. A spokesman for the sheriff’s office said, “The items are being analyzed to see whether they are connected to the case, which could take days, weeks or months”. The items uncovered are still being investigated as of 2020.</p><p>On September 6, 2016, the San Luis Obispo Sheriff Department reported it had received information about the possible location of Smart’s remains, resulting in a hillside excavation on the Cal Poly campus. After five days of digging, bones were recovered from at least one excavation site. However, it was initially unclear if the findings were animal or human, and forensic analysis may take months to determine.</p><p align=justify>Smart’s disappearance and slow response by the campus police resulted in the Kristin Smart Campus Security Act being written and sponsored by State Senator Mike Thompson, passed 61–0 by the California State Legislature, and signed into effect by then-Governor Pete Wilson on August 19, 1998. The law took effect on January 1, 1999, and requires all public colleges and publicly funded educational institutions to have their security services make agreements with local police departments about reporting cases involving or possibly involving violence against students, including missing students.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Disappearance of Kristin Smart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Djamel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Keddou</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Augsburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Stan Smart (father); Denise Smart (mother)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Disappearance of Kristin Smart ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
