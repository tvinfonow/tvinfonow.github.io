Who is John Macaluso dating now & how much money does John Macaluso have?</p><h2>John Macaluso Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>John Macaluso</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Drummer</strong> who was born on <strong>January 21, 1968</strong> in Commack, New York, <strong>United States</strong>. John Macaluso (born January 21 1968) is an American drummer who has performed in the bands Ark, TNT, and Yngwie Malmsteen, among other groups.&nbsp;He was born in Commack, New York, Macaluso began playing drums when he was the age of 11.&nbsp;Recorded on more than 200 albums and performed on numerous world tours, Macaluso continues to compose and record music as well as perform live, give workshops and teach.</p><p>In 2012, following some collaborations with guitarist Pier Gonella, Macaluso joined the group Mastercastle and recorded the drums for the album On Fire.</p><p>In September 2016, it was announced that Macaluso joined Italian band Labyrinth.</p><p>Having appeared on so many solo albums in his career, it was not long before Macaluso would decide to release one of his own. He was later approached by Lion Music for publishing and distribution. This record, entitled John Macaluso & UNION RADIO, received nothing but top reviews by journalists and music lovers worldwide. It is a drummer’s solo album but the drumming is just a piece of its brilliance. The songwriting, sound, production and melodies are outstanding. The album has a very dark vibe but is also uplifting. It is closely resembling a “Pink Floyd meets Rush hanging out with Radio Head and Zeppelin”. Full length audio tracks are available on http://www.johnmacaluso.com. Macaluso says, “This album was like my National Geographic Adventure to make. I knew who I wanted on the record and was going to go through any length to get them on the there and record and write, on the spot with them. This is why my album took a year and a half to write and record. I traveled to Italy to write and record with Marco Sfogli (James LaBrie Band), to France for Keys, Pennsylvania for piano with Vitalij Kuprij, James LaBrie recorded vocals in Canada. I went to California to do guitar with Alex Masi, England, New Jersey and of course New York where I did all my drums. It was a trip and a half, but the result is bigger than I ever imagined. I told myself ‘if I am going to make a record, I am going to make A RECORD’, and so I did, despite the cost or time. I am very proud of UNION RADIO and everyone on it kicked as for me and delivered some of the best performances I have ever heard them do. I have recorded and been on tours, in hotels, bars, tour busses and all over with the musicians on my record so I have heard what they can do. They all raised the bar on this album and kicked, Mike DiMeo, Adrian Holtz, James LaBrie, Randy Coven, DiMuti who really kicked, Ze Gray, Vitalij Kuprij, Larry Meyer, Don Chaffin, Alex Rastopchin, Fabrizio Grossi, Donna and Laura Macaluso, Kristen Drewes, Suzi, Dina Cook, Jack Frost and many more, thanks!”</p><p align=justify>Macaluso, John; Joe Hartoularos (November 28, 2007).&nbsp;“John Macaluso Biography”.&nbsp;Retrieved November 28, 2007 .</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John Macaluso</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Macaluso</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Commack</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>John Macaluso ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He would later organize and publish his documentation in a drum method book entitled Repercussions. John says, “The book is not just a book of beats and fills but besides that, it’s a book on opening your creativity on the drum kit. I feel the most important thing a drummer could have is a personal signature. This book will show you ways to build on that, through drum sound and tuning, hand techniques, recording tips and stories, learning when not to play, playing to a click and the three major ways to do it. This covers moments in time that have changed my life and the lives of drummers worldwide. It’s not drumming as a hobby, but drumming as a lifestyle. It’s stories and graphics including a CD that can also entertain even non-drummers.” John’s book is endorsed by drummers Joe Franco, Nicko McBrain (Iron Maiden) and Bobby Jarzombek (Rob Halford).</p><h2>John Macaluso Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>John Macaluso is one of the <strong>richest Drummer</strong> from United States.
