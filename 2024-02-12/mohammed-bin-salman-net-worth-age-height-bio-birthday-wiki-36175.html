Mohammed bin Salman’s first move as minister was to mobilise a pan-GCC coalition to intervene following a series of suicide bombings in Sana’a via air strikes against Houthis, and impose a naval blockade. In March 2015, Saudi Arabia began leading a coalition of countries allied against the Houthi rebels. While there was agreement among those Saudi princes heading security services regarding the necessity of a response to the Houthis’ seizure of Sana’a, which had forced the Yemeni government into exile, Prince Mohammed launched the intervention without full coordination across security services. Saudi National Guard Minister Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who was out of the country, was left out of the loop of operations. While Prince Mohammed bin Salman sold the war as a quick win on Houthi rebels in Yemen and a way to put President Hadi back in power, however, it became a long war of attrition.</p><h2>Mohammed bin Salman Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mohammed bin Salman is one of the <strong>richest Minister</strong> from Saudi Arabia.

Human Rights Watch warned that the al-Ghomgham case set a “dangerous precedent” for other women activists currently detained. HRW’s Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said, “Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behaviour, is monstrous. Every day, the Saudi monarchy’s unrestrained despotism makes it harder for its public relations teams to spin the fairy tale of ‘reform’ to allies and international business.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mohammed bin Salman height</b> Not available right now.
