Fan fan in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series who won numerous championships and led an extremely well-known life outside of the track.</p><p><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> played Cole Trickle, a character loosely based on Richmond, in the 1990 film Days of Thunder.&nbsp;played Cole Trickle, a character that was loosely based on Richmond in the film of the same name from 1990. Days of Thunder.</p><p>Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over. Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970. Richmond’s other interests included flying, and he earned his private pilot license at age 16. Following high school graduation, Richmond attended Ashland University for about one year before dropping out.</p><p>A friend of Richmond’s father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some practice laps. “Somebody put a stopwatch on me,” Richmond said. “I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the first time I had ever driven a race car.” Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car for the rest of the event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond’s father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son’s driving style. In 1977 Tim Richmond became both Sandusky Speedway’s Rookie of the Year and the SuperModified class track champion.</p><p align=justify>He was born living in Ashland, Ohio.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tim Richmond</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richmond</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Race Car Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ashland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Al Richmond, Evelyn Richmond</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sandy Welsh</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tim Richmond ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap, and he finished last (23rd).

He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. “I busted up a few Indy cars right after that,” he said. “Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at Michigan I cut one in two. I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt. So when I got an offer to drive stock cars, I took it, and it turned out I liked driving them better.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tim Richmond height</b> Not available right now.
