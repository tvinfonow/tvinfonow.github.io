According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Coach</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Benjamin “Coach” Wade (born (1971-09-18 ) September 18, 1971) is an American reality television personality best known for being a contestant on Survivor: Tocantins, Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, and Survivor: South Pacific. He grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee and later moved to Susanville, California, to conduct the Susanville Symphony and pursue “adventures” in Hollywood.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Conductor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2011, Wade returned to Survivor for the third time in Survivor: South Pacific, as the self-styled ‘Zen Slayer’ and one of two returning contestants (the other being Ozzy Lusth). During the season, Wade was assigned to the Upolu tribe through random draw, gaining the friendship of Edna Ma on the first day. On the first night, he made an alliance with Sophie Clarke, Rick Nelson, Albert Destrade, and Brandon Hantz, who later revealed to Wade that he was Russell Hantz’s nephew. Wade decided to trust Brandon Hantz, but still was wary of his outbursts. Wade and his four alliance members eliminated Christine Shields-Markoski, Stacey Powell and Mikayla Wingle, sending them all to Redemption Island. At camp, Wade found the Hidden Immunity Idol with the help of Destrade and Clarke, keeping it a secret from Hantz and Ma. Later on, Wade staged the Idol’s “discovery” for Hantz, under the guise of a prayer ritual. The tribes merged with six members each, prompting Wade to attempt to sway former Savaii member John Cochran over in order to avoid a tie. Wade’s alliance, now including Cochran, voted off the remaining Savaiis. Both Cochran and Ma, knowing that they were on the outside of the alliance, tried to get Wade to betray his original alliance; however, he decided against it. He went on to vote off Cochran first, followed by Ma. Wade, Clarke and Destrade ended up in the Final Three, and Wade finished second place only to Clarke, who won in a 6–3–0 vote.</p><p>In 1997, Wade was hired at Simpson University in Redding, California, to coach the women’s soccer team. He then spent 13 years coaching collegiate soccer teams and ended up at Southwest Baptist University from 2005 to 2009. After his appearance on Survivor, Wade was fired as head women’s soccer coach for the university. The university’s athletic director Brent Good had fired Wade for not telling the school that he would be taking two months off in order to participate in Survivor. Good stated in an interview, “He [Wade] said he was going to be gone for a week…the week went beyond that, which went beyond that, which went beyond that.” According to Good, Wade left the team with two weeks left in the season in October but did not return to the school until December. In 2010, he signed a contract to coach the men’s soccer team at Lassen College, a community college located in Susanville. On December 10, 2013, Wade was hired as the first ever men’s soccer head coach at Lake Tahoe Community College. After 20 years of coaching collegiate soccer he retired from that position in November 2015, to spend more time with his family. Wade has come out of retirement to take over the reins of the Redding Royals FC semi-pro soccer team, starting with the 2017 season.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Coach height</b> Not available right now.

Being one of the most controversial characters to ever play the game, he was recognized as the main antagonist of this season; however, Jeff Probst has stated he doesn’t feel like Wade did anything to earn this reputation. While in the game, he gave nicknames to his fellow tribemates: James “J.T.” Thomas, Jr., the “warrior”, Stephen Fishbach, the “wizard”, Tyson Apostol, the “assistant coach” (to which Apostol later wished to upgrade himself to “co-coach”), and himself, the “Dragon Slayer”. These players together formed the “Warrior Alliance”. Ultimately he made it to a fifth-place finish, and was the fifth member of the jury, as well, voting for Thomas to win the title of Sole Survivor.</p><h2>Who is Coach Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Coach</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
