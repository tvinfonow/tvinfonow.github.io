Who is Michael Pitts dating now & how much money does Michael Pitts have?</p><h2>Michael Pitts Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Michael Pitts</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pastor</strong> who was born on <strong>August 31, 1964</strong> in Lima, Lima Region, <strong>Peru</strong>.</p><p>Pitts gave an account of honing his ability by preaching to soda bottles as props while working a part-time convenience store job. He spent much of his later teenage years traveling from church to church, requesting an opportunity to preach. In 1984, at a tent revival in Defiance, Ohio, Kathi Gamble came to hear Pitts preach. The two met, started dating, and married later that year in Lima, Ohio.</p><p>In June 1986, with a $1,000 gift from his parents, the couple moved to Toledo to start a non-denominational church, which they named Cornerstone Church. The church opened with once-a-month Thursday evening meetings at what was then the Reynolds Road Holiday Inn. They advertised on the local gospel radio station, and on the first night, 18 people came. There was no written plan, no outreach plan, and little external funding. The original vision from God for the Church, given in 1984, years before the church’s formation, and still written on paper, stated “The plan is simply for God to have a church that is run on His divine order and inspiration. A church where people of all races, ethnic groups, and religious backgrounds can come together to worship God. A place where sinners will find grace and acceptance, and where they will be challenged to grow. A place where those who need healing and deliverance will find God ever present to meet their needs. A growing place. A happy place. A lighthouse to the whole city, ministering to the whole man.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael Pitts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michelle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ballentine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pastor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 31</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lima</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lima Region</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peru</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Michael Pitts ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The first Sunday service drew 35 people to a small storefront building, and due to its rapid growth, they had to move locations twice in the first four years, first to an old insurance office at the Byrne Hill Plaza, and then to a remodeled warehouse on Airport Highway. At the age of 26, Pastor Michael Pitts was now preaching to over 1,000 weekly members. In 1995, Pastor Pitts moved the Church to its present location on Reynolds Road in Maumee, just outside Toledo. The church had spent months remodeling what had been a department store into a 2,500-seat sanctuary. The multifaceted church building also features state-of-the-art children’s facilities for the more than 400 children to attend services each week. As of 2005 it became the largest church in Northwest Ohio, with 4,000 members. It was the first racially integrated church in the region. In 1998, Cornerstone Church purchased WDMN, an AM radio station in Toledo, and sold it in 2012 after a successful decade of playing wholesome Gospel and contemporary Christian music.</p><h2>Michael Pitts Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michael Pitts is one of the <strong>richest Pastor</strong> from Peru. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Michael Pitts</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Michael Pitts was born in south Lima, Ohio, in 1964 to factory workers Eugene and Brenda Pitts. His parents were raised attending church regularly, and were both filled with the Holy Ghost many years ago. Brenda played guitar and sang at Quickstep Pentecostal Holiness Church in Alger, Ohio, with Eugene serving in various roles of church governance. From an early age, Michael struggled with the unwavering, unquestioning faith of his parent’s church and soon became frustrated with the things that didn’t seem to make sense.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pastor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Bishop Pitts has had three mentors during his time in ministry. The first was Lester Sumrall, who died in 1996. The next was Carlton Pearson, who Bishop Pitts parted ways with after Pearson started preaching a “doctrine of inclusivity.” His current mentor is Bishop T.D. Jakes, the founder and senior pastor of The Potter’s House Church, Dallas.</p><p>The Fall of 1997 brought new prospects for Pitts, with the proposal to invest in the first minority owned TV station in Toledo. WMNT-TV, Channel 48, had barely stayed afloat for its first year of broadcasting from early 1996 and Cornerstone Church was approached to assist in covering the overhead. Over the next 8 years the Church invested over $800,000 into the station, eventually purchasing 37% ownership. Then, in 2005 the Church filed for a restraining order to halt its illegal attempted sale by then owner, Lamaree Marty Miller. This started a string of court cases that included the discovery of illegal activity and fraud by Mr Miller. In 2007 the Church severed all ties with Miller, who later filed bankruptcy and relocated.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Pitts height</b> Not available right now.
