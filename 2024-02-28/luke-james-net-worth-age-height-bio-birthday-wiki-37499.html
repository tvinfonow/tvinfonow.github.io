According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Luke James</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>James was born in the small town of Amble, Northumberland, and grew up supporting local club Sunderland. He joined the Academy of Hartlepool United at the age of 11, progressing through their youth system until he was offered a professional contract at the age of 16. James made his league debut for Hartlepool United on 17 December 2011 as a 46th minute substitute for James Brown in a 1–0 defeat by Colchester United. He made his first league starting appearance in a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic on 26 December 2011, in which he was voted Man of the Match for his performance. He scored his first goal, a 25-yard volley, in a 2–0 win over Rochdale on 7 January 2012. The goal was particularly memorable as it made him the youngest player ever to score for Hartlepool United at the age of 17 years and 64 days, 48 days younger than the previous record holder Steven Istead.</p><p align=justify>James managed to achieve all this on the pitch whilst also studying for a BTEC qualification in Sport at East Durham College and was subsequently awarded with the honour of being named Apprentice of the Month for December 2011 by the League Football Education committee. James continued his impressive form when he scored a brace in a 4–0 over Carlisle United on 28 January 2012, which would prove to be Hartlepool United’s biggest winning margin of the season. As a result of his performance he was named in the Football League Team of the Week. By now the 17-year–old had caught the attention of a number of larger clubs and in his next match, a 0–0 draw against Bournemouth on 11 February 2012, he was watched by 21 scouts. Premier League clubs Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers and Scottish Premier League side Celtic in particular were all thought to be keen on signing the young midfielder. However, it was later reported on 7 June 2012 that Newcastle United would not be pursuing their interest in the immediate future but would instead be keeping close tabs on James’ progress. At the end of his debut season, James had made 19 league appearances and had two of his three goals nominated for Hartlepool United’s Goal of the Season Award, with fans ultimately voting for his first Football League goal against Rochdale as the winner.</p><p align=justify>James maintained his impressive form into the 2012–13 season, making 25 league appearances and scoring 3 league goals, which culminated in him winning the League One Apprentice of the Year Award on 24 March 2013. He dedicated the award to the fans for their continued support despite the fact that the club was facing a relegation battle. Despite his own success, however, he was unable to prevent the club from being relegated from Football League One at the end of the season. At the end of the season, James found himself nominated, for a second consecutive year, for the Hartlepool United Goal of the Season Award for his goal in a 1–1 draw with Brentford on 20 April 2013, however, he ultimately lost out on the fan vote to teammate James Poole. In the close season, James was once again the subject of transfer speculation with Football League Championship sides Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield Town, as well as League One clubs Brentford and Shrewsbury Town all thought to have been considering a bid for the 18-year–old midfielder, however a formal offer was never made for him.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Luke James height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Luke <strong>weight</strong> <strong>176&nbsp; lbs</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>176&nbsp; lbs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On 6 July 2016, Bristol Rovers F.C. signed James on a season long loan from Peterborough United He scored in pre season with a consolation goal during a 5–1 defeat to the hands of Swansea City.
