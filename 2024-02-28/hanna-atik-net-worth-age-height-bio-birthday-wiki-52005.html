Who is Hanna Atik dating now & how much money does Hanna Atik have?</p><h2>Hanna Atik Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Hanna Atik</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Politician</strong> who was born on <strong>February 7, 1959</strong> in <strong>Lebanon</strong>. Atik was born in Al Hedd-Akkar, Northern Lebanon on February 7, 1959. He was raised by a non-political Maronite couple.&nbsp;Atik was raised in a modest home with his seven siblings. He pursued his education and cultivated the land alongside his parents, who were farmers from many previous generations.</p><p>At the age 17 Hanna Atik joined the SKS Force, Phalangist Party. This was the beginning of his long journey to the Lebanese Christian Cause.&nbsp;His devotion to his fellow soldiers earned him the nickname “Hanoun” early in his career.&nbsp;He was a remarkable soldier, with exceptional courage and determination.&nbsp;He grew with the Phalangist party’s evolution and joined the Lebanese Forces at its inception in 1982 under the leadership of Bachir Gemayel.</p><p>In 1985, during one the uprisings within the Lebanese Forces amongst its leaders in what is known as 15 Kenoun (January), Hanna Atik lost his brother, Rezkollah Yussuf Atik, at the age of twenty three (23) to martyrdom. Shortly after, he was unjustly detained for ten (10) days under the new leadership of the Lebanese Forces. However, he agreed to continue serving within the ranks of the Lebanese Forces pending two conditions: That all other detained LF members be released unharmed and that he, personally, will never obey an order to hold a gun against any of his comrades. On the other hand, he vowed to be the first on the defense line in case of any advancement from the enemy.</p><p>As believers do, he accepted God’s will and continued the journey, honoring and always remembering the sacrificed blood of his brother and of all the Christian martyrs. Throughout his many years of commitment to the Lebanese Forces, he held various positions including District Chief of the LF Headquarters (ka’ed mantakat l makarr l aam), Head of the 1st and 2nd Task Force (lafeet takteekee lel she3ba 1 and 2), and Commander of the 1st Defense Battalion (ka’ed lewa’ al difa3). Eventually, he became the Vice Chief of Staff (Na’eb ka’ed majles al arkan) and in 1991 he held the 1 out of 12 seats in the LF Leadership Council (3adu Majles Al Kiyada) and was appointed Head of the LF Youth Organization (Ameen l shabeb).</p><p align=justify>Hanna has been awarded many medallions of honours for his bravery and dedication to the Cause. This includes an Honorary sword, presented by President Bachir Gemayel to him in 1977, when he made him Officer (dabet)), Zahle’s Heroic Medallion 1981, and Saint Elige’s highest honorary award, which is only given to a few leaders in the community.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hanna Atik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hanna</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Atik</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lebanon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Hanna Atik ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Akkar was also witness to numerous vicious attacks in other parts of Lebanon.&nbsp;He was 16 years old when he first experienced the violence of war.

Hanna was also the first leader to allow women to join the military forces and held a dedicated Sadem training session specifically for females. As the Lebanese Forces experienced several coups d’états and numerous leaderships following the assassination of its founder, Bachir Gemayel, Hanna Atik kept his promise to the land, to his comrades and to his people by continuing to serve within the ranks of the Lebanese Forces, stemming out of his strong belief in the protection and the continuation of the existence of the Christians in Lebanon.
