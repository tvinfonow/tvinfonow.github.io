Who is MIA dating now & how much money does MIA have?</p><h2>MIA Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>MIA</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rapper</strong> who was born on <strong>July 18, 1975</strong> in London, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Sri Lankan-British rapper and visual artist best known for her hits “Paper Planes,” “Bad Girls,” and “Bring the Noize.”</p><p>She was heavily involved in international politics, and expressed her support for embattled Wikileaks founder, <a href=#>Julian Assange</a>.</p><p>Mathangi “Maya” Arulpragasam MBE (born 18 July 1975), known by her stage name M.I.A. (/ɛ m aɪ eɪ / ), is a British rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, visual artist, and activist. Combining elements of alternative, dance, electronic, hip hop, and world music, her early compositions relied heavily on the Roland MC-505 music sequencer and drum machine, whilst her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics, and unusual sound samples. M.I.A.’s music lyrically incorporates a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references. M.I.A. has embarked on five global headlining tours and is the founder of her own multimedia label, N.E.E.T.</p><p>Contrary to her present style, M.I.A.’s Arular era style has been described as “tattered hand me downs and patched T-shirts of indigents”, embodying the “uniform of the refugee” but modified with cuts, alterations and colours to fashion a distinctly new style and apparel line. M.I.A. built on this during the Kala era with a “playful” combination of baggy T-shirts, leggings and short-shorts. She incorporated eccentric accessories in bold patterns, sparkle and “over-saturated” neon colour to fashion her signature style which inspired flocks of “garishly-clothed all-too-sassy” new-rave girls with bright red tights, cheetah-skin smock and faded 1980s T- shirts. Her commodifying and performance of this refugee image has been noted to “reposition” perceptions of it in the wider public. Hailed as presenting a challenge to the mainstream with her ironic style, M.I.A. has been praised for dictating such a subcultural trend worldwide, combining “adolescent” frustrations of race and class with a strong desire to dance. Eddy Lawrence of Time Out commented how her multi genre style contributed to her being beloved of the broadsheet fashionistas yet simultaneously patron saint and pin-up for the Day-Glo nu-rave kids. Similarly, Mary Beth Ray, in the book Rock Brands: Selling Sound in a Media Saturated Culture writes that M.I.A.’s hybrid style addressed a number of social and political issues including power, violence, identity and survival in a globalised world, while using avenues that challenged “traditional” definitions of what it meant to be a contemporary pop artist.</p><p align=justify>She had a five year relationship with DJ <a href=#>Diplo</a>. From 2008 to 2012 she dated billionaire environmentalist <a href=#>Benjamin Bronfman</a>. She gave birth to their son, Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman, in 2009.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MIA</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MIA</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Arul Pragasam, Kala Pragasam</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Brother(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Terry Watanabe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ikhyd Edgar Arular Bronfman</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>MIA ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Her father arrived on the island and became an independent peace mediator between the two sides of the civil war in the late 1980s–2010. Arulpragasam spent the rest of her childhood and teenage years living on the Phipps Bridge Estate in the Mitcham district of south London, where she learned to speak English, whilst her mother brought the children up on a modest income. Arulpragasam entered the final year of primary school in the autumn of 1986 and quickly mastered the English language. Hers was one of only two Asian families on the estate at the time, in an atmosphere she has described as “incredibly racist.”</p><h2>MIA Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>MIA is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>MIA</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Born Mathangi Arulpragasam, she was always an artist. She published a book of her paintings inspired by the Tamil Rebellion in her native Sri Lanka.</p><p align=justify>Her hit “Paper Planes” hit multi-Platinum certification in Canada and the U.S., was certified Gold in New Zealand, and reached the Top 20 on the world charts.</p><p align=justify>Mathangi “Maya” Arulpragasam was born on 18 July 1975, in Hounslow, London, the daughter of Arul Pragasam, a Sri Lankan Tamil engineer, writer, and activist, and his wife, Kala, a seamstress. When she was six months old, her family moved to Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka, where her brother Sugu was born. There, her father adopted the name Arular and became a political activist and founding member of the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS), a political Tamil group affiliated with the LTTE. The first 11 years of Arulpragasam’s life were marked by displacement caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War. Her family went into hiding from the Sri Lankan Army, and Arulpragasam had little contact with her father during this period. She has described her family as living in “big-time” poverty during her childhood but also recalls some of her happiest memories from growing up in Jaffna. Maya attended Catholic convent schools such as the Holy Family Convent, Jaffna, where she developed her art skills—painting in particular—to work her way up her class.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While living in England and raising her children, Arulpragasam’s mother became a Christian in 1990 and worked as a seamstress for the Royal Family for much of her career. She worked from her home in London’s Tooting area. Arulpragasam has had a difficult relationship with her father, due to his political activities in the 1980s and complete absence during much of her life. Prior to the release of the first album, which Arulpragasam had named after her father, he emailed her: “This is Dad. Change the title of your album. I’m really proud. Just read about you in the Sri Lanka Times. Dad.” She chose not to change the album title. Arulpragasam attended the Ricards Lodge High School in Wimbledon. Following high school, she attended Central Saint Martins by gaining admittance through unconventional means despite not having formally applied. In 2000, she graduated from London’s Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design with a degree in fine art, film, and video.</p><p>Arulpragasam befriended students in the college’s fashion, advertising and graphics departments. She met Justine Frischmann, front woman of the British band Elastica, through her friend Damon Albarn at an Air concert in 1999, and Frischmann commissioned Arulpragasam to create the cover art for the band’s 2000 album, The Menace, and video document their American tour. Arulpragasam returned to Jaffna in 2001 to film a documentary on Tamil youth, but was unable to complete the project because she encountered harassment. In 2001, Arulpragasam’s first public exhibition of paintings after graduating took place at the Euphoria Shop on London’s Portobello Road. It featured graffiti art and spray-paint canvasses mixing Tamil political street art with images of London life and consumerist culture. The show was nominated for an Alternative Turner Prize and a monograph book of the collection was published in 2002, titled M.I.A.. Actor Jude Law was among early buyers of her art.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>MIA height</b> Not available right now.

From there, she developed an interest in hip-hop and dancehall, identifying with “the starkness of the sound” in records by Public Enemy, MC Shan and Ultramagnetic MCs; and the “weird, distinct style” of acts such as Silver Bullet and London Posse. In college she developed an affinity for punk and the emerging sounds of Britpop and electroclash. M.I.A. cites The Slits, Malcolm McLaren and The Clash as major influences.</p><p align=justify>From 2000 until 2010, she directed the video for Elastica single “Mad Dog God Dam” and videos for her songs “Bird Flu”, “Boyz”, “S.U.S. (Save Ur Soul)”, “Space” and “XXXO” as well as personally choosing the directors for the videos of her songs Galang, Sunshowers, which she described in 2005 and again in 2011 as being her favourite video experience and favourite video adaptation of a song of hers, in her words as of 2011, “If you watch only one of my videos, please try Sunshowers”, “Jimmy,” “Born Free,” and “Bad Girls.”, a video inspired by YouTube videos of car stunts and photographs, including one of an Arab female trucker, from the Middle East, which she described as her second favourite music video. She directed a video for Rye Rye’s “Bang”. She judged in the Music Video category at the inaugural Vimeo Festival & Awards in New York in October 2010.</p><h2>Who is MIA Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>MIA</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

You may help us to build the dating records for MIA!<p>M.I.A. has become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her music videos and her cover art. Her politically inspired art became recognised while she exhibited and published several of her brightly coloured stencils and paintings portraying the tiger, a symbol of Tamil nationalism, ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s. Lyrics on Arular regarding her experiences of identity politics, poverty, revolution, gender and sexual stereotypes, war, and the conditions of working class in London were hailed as new and unorthodox, setting her apart from previous artists. The album references the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Tamil independence movements and features culture jamming, multi-lingual slang, strident and subtle imagery. Her albums’ social commentary and storytelling have incited debate on the “invigoratingly complex” politics of the issues she highlighted in the album, breaking taboos while the West was engaged in the 2003 Iraq War in the Middle East during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Government visits to her official website following her debut album’s release in 2005, and a US refusal to grant M.I.A. a travel visa coupled with her brief presence on the US Homeland Security Risk List in 2006 due to her politically charged lyrics led to her second album Kala being recorded in a variety of locations around the world. The American Civil Liberties Union described the actions as part of a trend of ideological exclusion by the state which was detrimental to democracy by “censoring and manipulating debate”. In October 2016, she revealed on her Instagram that she had finally been approved for a US visa.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>MIA Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rapper</strong>.
