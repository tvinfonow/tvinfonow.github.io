Who is Kajal Aggarwal dating now & how much money does Kajal Aggarwal have?</p><h2>Kajal Aggarwal Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kajal Aggarwal</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Actor</strong> who was born on <strong>June 19, 1985</strong> in Mumbai, <strong>India</strong>. Kajal Aggarwal (born 19 June 1985) is an Indian film actress and model. She has established a career in the Tamil and Telugu film industries and has been nominated for four Filmfare Awards South.</p><p>Aggarwal had four releases in 2009. She first starred opposite Vinay Rai in the Tamil film Modhi Vilayadu, which garnered mixed reviews and was a financial failure. She then appeared in the high budget Telugu historical drama Magadheera, alongside Ram Charan Teja, which saw her playing double roles for the first time. The film, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, received overwhelming critical acclaim, while Aggarwal, in particular, was praised for her portrayal of a princess. Aggarwal was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress in Telugu and nominated for the award for Best Telugu Actress in the South Scope Awards for her performance. It was highly successful commercially and broke several records, emerging as the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time. Magadheera’s success turned Aggarwal into one of the most sought-after actresses in Telugu cinema. It was released again in Tamil as Maaveeran in 2011, and was also successful at the box office. Her subsequent releases Ganesh Just Ganesh, opposite Ram and Arya 2 opposite Allu Arjun received mixed reviews from critics, while her performance garnered positive feedback.</p><p>Aggarwal’s first 2010 release was A. Karunakaran’s romantic comedy Darling, which featured her alongside Prabhas and received a favorable response, becoming a commercial success at the box office, with Kajal receiving her second Filmfare nomination for Best Actress. Later that year, Aggarwal appeared in the Tamil thriller film Naan Mahaan Alla, opposite Karthi, which was based on a real-life incident and opened to positive reviews. It was a box office success. The chemistry between Karthi and Aggarwal was widely praised. It was later dubbed in Telugu as Naa Peru Siva in Andhra Pradesh and was a success. Aggarwal’s final release in 2010 was another romantic comedy Brindavanam opposite Jr. NTR and Samantha, which received critical acclaim and went on to become a commercial success, while fetching Aggarwal the CineMAA Award for Best Actress.</p><p>She subsequently starred in Telugu films such as Darling (2010), Brindavanam (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), Businessman (2012), Naayak (2013), Baadshah (2013), Govindudu Andarivadele (2014), Temper (2015) and Khaidi No. 150 (2017). Kajal also played the female lead in the high-profile Tamil projects Naan Mahaan Alla (2010), Maattrraan (2012), Thuppakki (2012), Jilla (2014),Vivegam (2017) and Mersal (2017). She made a comeback to Bollywood with Singham (2011), which was a hit, while another film Special 26 (2013) was also a box office success.</p><p align=justify>Aggarwal made her debut in the Telugu film industry and played her first leading role in 2007 in Teja’s Lakshmi Kalyanam, alongside Kalyan Ram; it did not fare well at the box office. Later that year, she appeared in the Krishna Vamsi-directed Chandamama, which opened to positive reviews and became her first major successful film. In 2008, she had her first Tamil film release, Perarasu’s action entertainer Pazhani, co-starring Bharath. She had two more Tamil releases that year with Venkat Prabhu’s comedy-thriller Saroja, in which she did a guest appearance, and Bharathiraja’s investigative thriller Bommalattam. Although the former went on to become a commercial as well as a critical success, both films failed to boost her career as her roles were too insignificant. Her Telugu releases Pourudu and Aatadista opposite Sumanth and Nitin, respectively, did not receive positive reviews, but both were successful at the box office.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kajal Aggarwal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kajal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aggarwal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1985</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mumbai</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Vinay Agarwal</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Suman Agarwal</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kajal Aggarwal ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
