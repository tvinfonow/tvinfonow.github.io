Famous for his work with the Jamaican reggae band Inner Circle, he is also notable for his solo recordings, which include the 1978 album Dread Dread and the 1980 LP Mixed Up Moods.</p><p>He and fellow reggae vocalist <a href=#>Gregory Isaacs</a> were both in the cast of the 1978 Jamaican movie Rockers.</p><p>He recorded three songs for Dodd, including “Love is a Message” in 1968, which the Swaby brothers, Horace and Garth (Horace would later become known as Augustus Pablo) played at their Rockers Sound System. The song did not garner much success, nor did it get much attention from Coxsone, however it resulted in Horace Swaby befriending Miller and sparked his interest in him as a musician.</p><p>After the Swaby brothers launched their own label in 1972, Horace (from then on known as Augustus Pablo) recorded a version of “Love is a Message” named “Keep on Knocking” in 1974. In the next year and a half, Miller recorded five more songs for Pablo, “Baby I Love You So”, “False Rasta”, “Who Say Jah No Dread”, “Each One Teach One”, and “Girl Named Pat”, each of which became a Rockers classic with King Tubby dubs on their b-sides. These singles developed Miller’s reputation as a great singer, and their success ultimately drew Inner Circle to hire him as a replacement lead singer.</p><p align=justify>The son of Desmond Elliot and Joan Ashman, he was born in Mandeville, Jamaica, and raised by his grandparents in Kingston, Jamaica. Tragically, he was killed in a car crash (along with his son) when he was just twenty seven years old.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jacob Miller</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jacob</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Miller</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reggae Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jamaica</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jacob Miller ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The track which has brought him the most lasting recognition is the rockers standard “King Tubby Meets The Rockers Uptown” with Augustus Pablo, a dub of “Baby I Love You So,” engineered by King Tubby. Other notable tracks with Augustus Pablo included “Keep on Knocking”, “False Rasta”, and “Who Say Jah No Dread”, all produced by Pablo.
