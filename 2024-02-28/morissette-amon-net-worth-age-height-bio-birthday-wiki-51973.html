Who is Morissette Amon dating now & how much money does Morissette Amon have?</p><h2>Morissette Amon Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Morissette Amon</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>R&B Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>June 2, 1996</strong> in Cebu, <strong>Philippines</strong>. Filipina singer who became famous after placing second in the singing contest “Star Factor”.&nbsp;Her music videos for singles, such as 2014’s “Moon of Desire”, are also well-known.</p><p>For her audition on “Star Factor”, she sang “Love on Top” by&nbsp;She sang the <a href=#>Beyonce Knowles</a> song “Love on Top” for her audition on “Star Factor”..</p><p>Johanne Morissette Daug Amon (born June 2, 1996), better known by her stage name, Morissette, is a Filipina singer, rapper, dancer, multi-instrumentalist, actress, recording artist, and television personality. She first rose to prominence when she finished runner-up on TV5’s Star Factor at the age of 14. In 2012, Amon made her professional stage debut in the Repertory Philippines production of Disney’s Camp Rock. She competed in the first season of ABS-CBN’s The Voice of the Philippines in 2013, where she became part of Sarah Geronimo’s team.</p><p>Her loss in The Voice of the Philippines did not stop her career as Morissette went on with TV guestings, mall tours, and other activities together with her fellow Voice of the Philippines finalists. Despite her departure from the competition, comparisons between her and Sarah Geronimo, her mentor, continued to hound her. This was not helped by the fact that the two have a striking resemblance to each other, an observation which Sarah herself acknowledged during the blind audition, and was noticed as early as her 2010 audition for Talentadong Pinoy. Moreover, even at the outset two judges in the audition noted similarities in the vocal style of the two singers, which was unsurprising given that Amon has always acknowledged Geronimo as a major influence on her, to the point of calling Sarah as her “idol”. In an interview, Amon clarified that in the beginning she felt hurt from the comparisons, but at present she considers it an honor. She further elaborated that she will just have to do “something different” and find the means to break away from the shadow of her former mentor, and thus establish her own identity.</p><p align=justify>When she was sixteen, she was the sole breadwinner of her family.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Morissette Amon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Morissette</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1996</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cebu</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Philippines</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amay Amon, Analie Daug</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeremy Mattheu Amon</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Morissette Amon ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Her work at TV5 gave her the means to sustain her family; while she enjoyed acting, singing was Amon’s true passion. With the blessing of TV5, she decided to join ABS-CBN’s new singing competition, The Voice of the Philippines. She considered this to be a risky move because it meant starting over again, and because there was the risk of failing in the blind auditions.</p><h2>Morissette Amon Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Morissette Amon is one of the <strong>richest R&B Singer</strong> from Philippines. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Morissette Amon</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>When she was fourteen years old, she auditioned to “Star Factor.”</p><p align=justify>In 2011, she tried acting for the first time, playing Young Carlota in “Rod Santiago’s The Sisters”.</p><p align=justify>Johanne Morissette Daug Amon, also known as Morissette or Mowie, was born on June 2, 1996, in Cebu City, Philippines, to her mother Analie Daug and father Amay Amon. She’s the first child and has one sibling, Jeremy Mattheu Amon. Her family has always been into music, or musically inclined. Her father is a rocker, and his favorite singer was Alanis Morissette. Her name “Johanne”, which is pronounced as “Yohan”, was coined by her father from German composer and musician of the Baroque period, Johann Sebastian Bach, while “Morissette” was taken from Canadian singer Alanis Morissette. She was 3 years old when her family discovered her talent in singing. When she was left alone with a karaoke machine, she sang the Regine Velasquez song, “You are My Song”. As she grew up, she sang Jessa Zaragoza songs like “Paano Na Kaya”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>She had the rare opportunity to perform with an internationally-known singer during Jessie J’s Live in Manila Concert on the 14th of July 2014 at Smart Araneta Coliseum. Morissette was tasked to interview Jessie J for the music channel Myx and during the interview, she mentioned that she sang one of her songs when she joined The Voice of the Philippines. Jessie J then requested Amon to sing in front of her, and despite being hesitant, she sang a portion of the singer’s hit song “Who You Are”. This impressed Jessie J so much that she immediately decided to invite Amon to join her onstage during her concert later in the evening. The singer even took to Instagram to express her admiration at Morissette’s talent, saying “The moment @itsmorissette sang to me and told me she auditioned for The Voice Philippines and came 2nd … So great! So I invited her out to sing with me. Love when this happens.”</p><p>In November 2014 Morissette sang several Disney songs in a two-day concert entitled Disney in Concert: A Tale as Old as Time, along with Sam Concepcion and Karylle, with accompaniment from the ABS-CBN Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Gerard Salonga.

She starred alongside Markki Stroem, who played Shane Gray. The musical play was held at Onstage, Greenbelt 1, Makati City from November 16 until December 16. Amon enjoyed this first stint in theater thoroughly, but using her voice at full tilt during rehearsals and the play itself took its toll. She started losing her voice after performances, prompting consultation with a doctor who diagnosed her with vocal cord nodules.</p><p align=justify>In May 2014, Amon held her very first solo concert entitled This Is Me which also doubled as her 18th birthday celebration. Her repertoire included hits from international singers such as Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Christina Perri, as well as those from local singers such as Regine Velasquez. She even paid homage to the inspiration for her name by singing Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic” and “You Learn”, albeit altered to suit her singing style. During this concert she announced that she was already a part of Star Records, although her formal contract signing for a one-year contract was done later on August 14, 2014 at ABS-CBN.</p><h2>Who is Morissette Amon Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Morissette Amon</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
