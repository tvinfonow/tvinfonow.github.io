The rapper was born Dennis Coles, he is a rapper and a member of Wu-Tang Clan whose first solo album, Ironman, debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1996.</p><p>He is a member of Wu-Tang Clan together with&nbsp;He is in Wu-Tang Clan with <a href=#>Robert Diggs</a>, who is also known as RZA., who is also popularly known as RZA.</p><p>A roommate of Wu-Tang founder RZA, Ghostface helped bring together the other seven members. In 1995, Ghostface guest-starred extensively on fellow Clan member Raekwon’s debut album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…, appearing on almost every song and receiving nearly equal billing. He also contributed songs to the Sunset Park and Don’t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtracks, which would be included on his first solo LP, Ironman, in 1996. The album, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, had a more pronounced soul influence (particularly 1970s soul) than previous Wu-Tang releases, and Ghostface’s future albums would continue to feature this stylistic trait.</p><p>In 2000, he released his second studio album Supreme Clientele. The album was well received by critics and peaked #7 on the Billboard 200. It included “Apollo Kids”, a popular single which featured Raekwon and had a sample of “Cool Breeze” by Solomon Burke. “Cherchez LaGhost”, another single off the album, became a minor club hit. Supreme Clientele would be a turning point in RZA’s influence on his sound, as only six songs are produced by the RZA, compared to Ironman, its predecessor where every song but one is produced by him. Though he contributed fewer beats to the project, RZA personally oversaw the mixing and production of the album as a whole, contributing to Supreme Clientele’s unified sound.</p><p align=justify>There is a son who is named Sun God.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ghostface Killah</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ghostface</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Killah</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Staten Island</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sun God</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ghostface Killah ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
