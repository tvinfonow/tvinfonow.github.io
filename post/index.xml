While his habit for avoiding mainstream artificiality in favor of small, intense, independent vehicles is quite intact, in retrospect it looks as if he has purposely avoided glossy Hollywood stardom in search of quality work. The son of an engineer father (Peter) and drama teacher mother (Cynthia), Benedict John Greenwood was born and raised in Windsor, England, the youngest of four children.</description></item><item><title>Blaine Edwards (Damon Wayans) and Antoine Merriweather (David Alan Grier)</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/l6jmycf-23166.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/l6jmycf-23166.html</guid><description>"Men on..."

The Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), also known as the Duck-billed Platypus, is a semiaquatic egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.
Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth.

The show ran for four years, opening the door wide for him for television and film roles. In 1993, he wrote and starred in a one-hour HBO television special, Pauly Does Dallas (1993), which drew in even more loyal fans. He had roles in films from 1988, providing supporting comedy relief, but it was the wildly popular El hombre de California (1992), partnered with Sean Astin and Brendan Fraser, that put Pauly squarely on the map.</description></item><item><title>Phoebe Augustine</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/xn1l96e-21470.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/xn1l96e-21470.html</guid><description>Tags: Twin Peaks (1), American Girl (1), Raven Haired (1), Fire Walk With Me (1) My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunC8x6icm51dlsKowdKtoKed</description></item><item><title>Pik Sen Lim</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/sio7z6f-21407.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/sio7z6f-21407.html</guid><description>Pik-Sen Lim (Chinese: 林碧笙, born 15 September 1944) is a Malaysian Chinese actress based in the United Kingdom who has appeared on British television since the 1960s.

Despite my love for RDJ, Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams, they could not save the very dull Sherlock Holmes movies. However, that being said, I still was very fond of Holmes as a character. RDJ did him very well. He seems to have a talent for the quirky, dry-humored characters. Sherlock definitely has a lot of inner demons, and uses his humor to hide that.</description></item><item><title>Gunilla Knudson</title><link>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/33yk6vk-21370.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/33yk6vk-21370.html</guid><description>Description: Most famous for a series of TV commercials she made for Noxzema Shaving Cream in 1966, in which the camera showed a close-up of her face as she purred, "Take it off, take it all off!" while David Rose's "The Stripper" played in the background.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka
The quokka (Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat.
Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as the kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. It can be found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, in particular on Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany.</description></item><item><title>Felix Mallard pictures and photos</title><link>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/edl1ivr-21262.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/edl1ivr-21262.html</guid><description>Post an image Sort by: Recent - Votes - Views « Prev12 Next » ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCyxKWgsWWdlrmtrdGdZqmhk6nCs7HS</description></item><item><title>Fictional Characters > Robert+mccollum Fictional Characters</title><link>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/631lquf-21265.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/631lquf-21265.html</guid><description>Fictional Characters tagged as 'Robert+mccollum' by the Listal community

People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out.

The Nerd really adds some depth to his coverage of video game history, along with the trademark humor. The first disc is fantastically funny and the Odyssey system review is particularly impressive, since the "console" is from 1972. My favourite is the Terminator games retrospective. Two great movies, tons of shitty video games and one awesome strategy to get extra lives that didn't quite work.</description></item><item><title>Bibi Besch</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/fywb3b4-20541.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/fywb3b4-20541.html</guid><description>Tags: Died 1996 (3), Star Trek (2), Actress (2), Austrian (2), Born 1940 (2), Star Trek Movies (2), Cancer (1), Deceased (1), Born 1942 (1), Died Aged 54 (1) My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCuyJugZpqVqLCp</description></item><item><title>Born 1990 actors &amp;amp; actresses</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/lluvjvj-20509.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/lluvjvj-20509.html</guid><description>Actors tagged as 'Born 1990' by the Listal community

Though some hybrid titles and recent FPS-style RPGs really blur up these RPG genres, the best way to distinguish them is this way:
Epic RPG: Massive worlds, long gameplay (50+ hrs is typical), very detailed levelling up &amp;amp; characters stats, more open-ended gameplay, slower-paced but detailed quests.</description></item><item><title>Samuel West</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/2pbqcxt-20533.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/2pbqcxt-20533.html</guid><description>Tags: British (2), Actor (2), English (1), Narnia (1), Hornblower (1), Mr. Selfridge (1) My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunC%2FwKasnqRdrLK0wA%3D%3D</description></item><item><title>Sarah Lieving</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/l3yvuhb-20494.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/l3yvuhb-20494.html</guid><description>Description: Sarah Lieving began her acting career in 2002 with a minor role in the film Coastlines (2002). 2005 proved to be a busy year for Sarah as she found roles in the video film adaptation of War of the Worlds (2005).

On May 13, 1972, Blocker died in Los Angeles of a pulmonary embolism following gall bladder surgery. The writers of Bonanza took the unusual step of referencing a major character's death in the show's storyline that autumn. Bonanza lasted another season without Hoss, as the final and fourteenth season ended nine episodes shy of a full season - on January 16, 1973.</description></item><item><title>Dap Sugar Willie pictures and photos</title><link>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/khrxqcz-19989.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/khrxqcz-19989.html</guid><description>Post an imagencG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCwwKlkrK2Xlr9uw8ilo6KdX6W2pMDUq5ys</description></item><item><title>Dariusz Siatkowski</title><link>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/fkanjrn-20014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/fkanjrn-20014.html</guid><description>My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCwwKugrquqYsCqrdOkprCrm54%3D</description></item><item><title>Debra Romer pictures and photos</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/7kpwlhh-19993.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/7kpwlhh-19993.html</guid><description>Post an image Sort by: Recent - Votes - Views ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCwxJupmmWipLqmvo6poJyspaeytA%3D%3D</description></item><item><title>Don Kress movies</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/85lrqjr-19991.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/85lrqjr-19991.html</guid><description>Don Kress movies 7.5

Well, he don't as far as I know have anything to do with this, but the story and gameplay is so Hollywood. Full of drama, U.S. flag waving and ofcourse U.S. is again the only victim. All of those things works better in games than in movies, this is a living proof of it. I love this game. When player itself feels all the patriotism, great (scripted) action and drama the feeling is unspeakable.</description></item><item><title>Trinity Trice pictures and photos</title><link>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/68dcon8-19363.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/68dcon8-19363.html</guid><description>Post an image Sort by: Recent - Votes - Views ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunDA0aKloqypYsGztcKeZqmhk6nCs7HS</description></item><item><title>Troy Gentile</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/zr8vqny-19326.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/zr8vqny-19326.html</guid><description>Tags: American (2), Actor (2), Child Actor (1), Born In 1993 (1), The Goldbergs (1) My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunDA0aiwZp%2BVo8GquMQ%3D</description></item><item><title>Tuffy Smurf</title><link>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/zgskr7w-19350.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/zgskr7w-19350.html</guid><description>Tuffy Smurf (original French name Schtroumpf Batailleur) is one of the characters of the Smurfs...

The Great Dane is a German breed of domestic dog known for its giant size. It is a short-haired breed with a strong, galloping figure.
The Great Dane combines, in its regal appearance, dignity, strength and elegance with great size and a powerful, well-formed, smoothly muscled body. It is one of the giant working breeds but is unique in that its general conformation must be so well balanced that it never appears clumsy and shall move with a long reach and powerful drive.</description></item><item><title>Fumiya Takahashi</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/d7ni6th-19103.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/d7ni6th-19103.html</guid><description>Description: Fumiya Takahashi is a Japanese actor and chef who portrays Aruto Hiden in Kamen Rider Zero-One.

Sandro’s life here is somewhat monotonous. He works in a fertiliser factory, goes swimming and spends his evenings doing jigsaw puzzles of landscapes. Sandro has a purely sexual relationship with his colleague Ricardo. He always seems to be a bit of an outsider, not comfortable in his own skin, not really belonging. When Maicon, a man straight out of a Tom-of-Finland illustration, shows up in their small town and flirts with Ricardo, Sandro’s burgeoning feelings of jealousy set a change in motion.</description></item><item><title>Elliadria 'Persuasian' Griffin pictures and photos</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/oph3nm1-18710.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/oph3nm1-18710.html</guid><description>Post an imagencG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCxy6Wgmpyinq5ucZFwp56qo6qutLXAp1xrb12cv6qyxaKlaKiZmMG2vsSs</description></item><item><title>Evil Toons (1992)</title><link>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/jb0y2c2-18661.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/jb0y2c2-18661.html</guid><description>Four sexy young girls are to clean an old house for the new owners.
