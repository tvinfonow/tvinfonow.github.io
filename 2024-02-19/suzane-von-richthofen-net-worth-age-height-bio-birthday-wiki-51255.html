Suzane Louise of Richthofen (born on November 3 1983) is a Brazilian accused murderer who was found guilty of killing her parents on the 31st of October 2002, with assistance of her boyfriend and brother.&nbsp;Her trial began before a judge in Sao Paulo in July 2006 and given 40 years prison.</p><p>The police investigating the case were unsure, however, that the burglary was really a crime and believed that the perpetrators had connections to the victims. They quickly began questioning the children and personnel from the Richthofen family.&nbsp;The reason they were suspicious was not just the scene of the crime, with the alarm system off and the newspapers being distributed frequently, almost as if deliberately however, Suzane’s incredibly cool behavior. She was in the home’s the pool along with Daniel just days after the murder and also celebrated her 19th birthday with her friends shortly after the funeral of her parents.&nbsp;The police concentrated their attention to Suzane and her boyfriend , and began to follow the pair.&nbsp;The evidence for their arrest was Christian Cravinhos, who had purchased a motorcycle just in the following days and had paid in cash 100-dollar bills.&nbsp;After a few days on the 9th of November 2002, he was arrested together with their brother as well as Suzane who admitted to the killing.&nbsp;Suzane had been released from jail in May 2005 when Suzane was released from prison when the Supreme Court of Justice granted her the right to habeas corpus.&nbsp;Suzane waited for her trial in house arrest.</p><p>On June 5, 2006, Suzane von Richthofen, along with the Cravinhos brothers, was put on trial in São Paulo for homicídio qualificado, the equivalent of First Degree Murder in Brazilian law. The trial was delayed and finally started on July 17. On trial, Suzane blamed Daniel Cravinhos for everything, while the Cravinhos brothers claimed that they acted on her wishes. Prosecutor Roberto Tardelli, however, called Suzane the “mastermind” of the crime. Roberto Tardelli called for 50 years imprisonment for each of the three defendants. Suzane was described as a “personification of the evil blonde”. On July 22, 2006, Suzane was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the crime. Daniel Cravinhos got the same sentence and his brother Christian was sentenced to 38 years for conspiracy.</p><p>In 2018, a justice denied request of freedom for von Richthofen, citing her egocentrism and a narcissistic personality disorder as serious personality traits that may have led to her crime.</p><p align=justify>Suzane’s parents, who initially first accepted her relationship with Daniel Cravinhos, changed their opinions after discovering that Cravinhos smoked marijuana almost every day.&nbsp;In addition, his poor background and inability to go to work or school caused them to disagree.&nbsp;In July 2002 her parents were away off on vacation, and Daniel lived with the kids for a whole month, much to the delight of Suzane.&nbsp;After the parents returned to their home, Suzane suggested they buy her a house where she could stay with Daniel However, her father rejected the idea and said she could do what she wanted to only if she could earn money on her own.&nbsp;Suzane continued to meet Daniel in secret.&nbsp;Suzane said that she did everything out of love, in the fear that Daniel might leave her if her parents weren’t killed.&nbsp;Her lawyer, Denivaldo Bari claimed that Suzane had no motivation in the first place, but was compelled to commit be guilty by Daniel who she adored as the god she was.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Suzane von Richthofen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Suzane</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richthofen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Athlete</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>São Paulo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brazil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Manfred Albert von Richthofen, Marisia von Richthofen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Andreas Albert von Richthofen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Suzane von Richthofen ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was also the chief engineer of the Mario Covas beltway project.&nbsp;Suzane has one younger brother, Andreas Albert of Richthofen.&nbsp;After having graduated from an German High School, Suzane went on to study law in the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo.&nbsp;At the end of summer 1999 she began taking an Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu class, and she was introduced to Daniel Cravinhos de Paula e Silva who later became her boyfriend.</p><p align=justify>Suzane’s family declared a wealth in the amount of R$5.5 million.&nbsp;Prosecutors suspect two accounts that were not named at Swiss banks, which contained at minimum EUR10 millions were created by her father in her name in November 2001 when she was 18 years old.&nbsp;Manfred von Richthofen is thought to have swindled the cash from DERSA.&nbsp;Since the accounts are under Suzane’s name, there is nothing that can stop her from accessing the funds once she’s served her sentence.</p><p align=justify>In the late hours of October 31, 2002, Suzane von Richthofen, who had planned the murder of her parents for months, checked if they were already asleep, then disconnected the alarm system of the estate and opened the door to her 21-year-old-boyfriend, Daniel Cravinhos and his brother, 26-year-old Christian Cravinhos, who had been waiting outside. The Cravinhos brothers went upstairs to the parents’ bedroom and hit them with iron bars before strangling them with towels. Suzane was waiting in the living room downstairs. After the murder was accomplished, the three simulated a break-in by pocketing money they found, spreading papers in the library, and creating a mess in the house. Then they left; Suzane and Daniel went to a motel, while Christian went to a fast-food restaurant. Early in the morning, Suzane and Daniel picked up her little brother, Andreas, then aged 15, at an internet cafe and went home, where they “discovered” the crime, called the police at once and told them their story.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Athlete</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Suzane von Richthofen height</b> Not available right now.
