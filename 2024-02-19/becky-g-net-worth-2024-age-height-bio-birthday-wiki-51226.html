While working on her debut effort, Gomez collaborated with artists will.i.am, Cody Simpson and Cher Lloyd. Her official debut single, “Becky from the Block” (2013), received a positive reception upon its release. She released her debut extended play, Play It Again (2013), later that same year. Her second single, “Can’t Get Enough” (2014), featured guest vocals from Pitbull and went on to top the Latin Rhythm Airplay chart in the United States.</p><p>Gomez appeared in the short film El Tux (2008) as Claudia Gómez and as Nina in the Discovery Channel television film La estación de la Calle Olvera (2008).

In reference to her video clip for “Otis”, Luke claimed “I would have signed her off that video alone. I was 100 percent in. She has so much personality and her voice just pops out of the speakers. Then I met her and discovered she could also sing and play the guitar and I thought, ‘This is even better.’ Then I found out she could write and it was like, ‘What else are you going to tell me, that you’re also Van Gogh?’ Her potential is limitless.” Shortly after signing with the label, Gomez began work on her debut album.</p><p align=justify>Her grandparents from both sets originate originated from Jalisco, Mexico.&nbsp;Her birth name is Rebbeca Marie Gomez.
