They began performing together around Los Angeles and were soon discovered by rapper/entrepreneur Eazy-E, who signed them to his label Ruthless Records in 1992. At the time, Will was known as “Will 1X”. Atban Klann’s first ever official track, “Merry Muthafuckin’ Xmas”, was included on Eazy-E’s EP 5150: Home 4 tha Sick. After this, the trio began recording an album, “Grass Roots”, with the help of producers Mookie Mook and DJ Motiv8, but the album was never released due to Eazy-E’s death in 1995.

While attending John Marshall High School, he became best friends with Allan Pineda (stage name apl.de.ap), who would also be a future member of the Black Eyed Peas.

Originally, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with Eden’s Crush. Danté Santiago then introduced Fergie to will.i.am, who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. Nine out of the fourteen tracks were composed by lyricist Robbie Fisher, who has been working closely with the band since the beginning stages of the album.
