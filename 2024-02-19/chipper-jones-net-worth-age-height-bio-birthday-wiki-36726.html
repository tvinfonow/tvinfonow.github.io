Ironically, Jones was not selected for the MLB All-Star game that year. He was also walked intentionally 18 times; 2nd in the league, and his .633 slugging percentage was 4th best in the NL.

The Braves led the National League East by only one game as they entered a three-game September series against the Mets, the team that was right on their heels. Atlanta swept the series at Turner Field, though, largely thanks to Jones, who hit four home runs and drove in seven of the thirteen runs that the Braves scored. For the season, he hit .319 with a .510 on-base percentage, a 1.000 slugging percentage, and seven home runs against the Mets. During the 1999 NLCS, Jones drew the ire of Mets fans by saying, “Now, all the Mets fans can go home and put their Yankees’ stuff on.” In the playoffs, Jones led the Braves to the World Series against the New York Yankees, in which the Braves were swept.</p><h3>What does Chipper Jones do now?</h3><p>On July 29, 2018, he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.
