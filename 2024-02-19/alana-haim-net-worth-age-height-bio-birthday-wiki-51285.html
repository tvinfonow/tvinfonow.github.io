Who is Alana Haim dating now & how much money does Alana Haim have?</p><h2>Alana Haim Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Alana Haim</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Guitarist</strong> who was born on <strong>December 15, 1991</strong> in Los Angeles, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Guitarist and one of the founders of the indie rock band Haim. They went on to release their debut LP Days Are Gone in 2013, along with the album Days Are Gone.</p><p>Their sound has often been compared to that of <a href=#>Stevie Nicks</a> and Fleetwood Mac.</p><p>The three sisters, Este Arielle Haim (born March 14, 1986), Danielle Sari Haim (born February 16, 1989) and Alana Mychal Haim (born December 15, 1991) were all born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, California, and are Jewish. Their Israeli-born father Mordechai (“Moti”) and their mother Donna were both musical; though he had been a professional soccer player in Israel, Moti also played drums, while Donna won a contest on The Gong Show in the 1970s singing a Bonnie Raitt song. While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second hand Fender for $50. The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents’ 1970s classic rock and Americana records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar. The group played typical wedding band material, including the Beatles’ “Get Back”, Billy Joel’s “You May Be Right” and Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl”, but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches, schools and hospitals.</p><p>Danielle and Este were members of the pop-rock group the Valli Girls, and appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Their song “Valli Nation” by the “SoCal teen prodigies” appeared on the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards soundtrack alongside established musicians Avril Lavigne, Alicia Keys, Simple Plan and Good Charlotte.</p><p align=justify>She grew up into a musically-inclined household in the San Fernando Valley, where their parents played 1970s classic rock records. Their whole family started a band called Rockinhaim.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alana Haim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Haim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1991</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mordechai Haim, Donna Haim</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Danielle Haim, Este Haim</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alana Haim ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

For their first gig, the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in matzah ball soup. Early gigs were sparsely populated; Danielle recalled, “We were [at the] bottom of the bill at 50-capacity venues and no one would show up.”</p><h2>Alana Haim Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Alana Haim is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United States.

According to Metro, their music sounds like folk-rock “with a few R&B/hip-hop stylings thrown in for good measure”. The group are fans of, and have been influenced by Beyoncé, covering her song “XO” on BBC Radio 1’s “Live Lounge”, and described “My Song 5” as “ripping off” Timbaland.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After graduating from high school, Danielle was spotted by musician Jenny Lewis at a jam session in Laurel Canyon, which led to Danielle joining Lewis’ touring band. The Strokes’ singer Julian Casablancas came to see one of Lewis’s shows on tour, and he in turn asked Danielle to play guitar and percussion on his solo tour. Danielle rehearsed with Casablancas’ band every day for two months, which she later described as “an eye-opening experience.” Following working with Casablancas from late 2009 to mid 2010, she auditioned for a place in Scarlet Fever, the all-female backing band for CeeLo Green. Danielle performed only once with the group, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.</p><p>For the next five years, Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career, because all three sisters were busy with other projects. Este was studying at UCLA and graduated in 2010 with a degree in Ethnomusicology (completed in just two years instead of the normal five), specializing in Bulgarian and Brazilian music.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Alana Haim height</b> <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong> Alana <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the cover band Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, Moti and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards. They formed Haim with younger sister Alana in 2007, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.</p><p align=justify>After playing shows supporting Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, The Henry Clay People and Kesha, Haim released the EP Forever, which included three songs in February 2012 as a time-limited free download on their website. Dash Hutton officially joined as drummer at the EP’s release party at the Los Angeles Bootleg Theatre. He is the son of Three Dog Night’s Danny Hutton and knew Este socially after she had seen his old band, Wires on Fire. The EP received attention from the music industry following a successful series of shows at the South by Southwest festival in March. Danielle recalled the first show was “maybe a disaster”, but the remainder of the shows attracted more attention. The band subsequently signed a deal with Polydor Records in the UK in June.</p><h2>Who is Alana Haim Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Alana Haim</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Alana Haim celebrates birthday on December 15 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In her survey of pop music in 2013, Observer critic Kitty Empire praised the band for “using the vector of harmonies to splice R&B with 1970s soft rock. They laid waste, too, to a herd of ghastly old hobby horses about guitar bands being unmarketable and record sales only being tied to women’s state of undress.” The Independent was more ambivalent about the band, saying there was “an insubstantiality at their core” of their music, as they “plug[ged] unashamedly” into the heritage of acts such as Fleetwood Mac and The Bangles, ultimately finding Haim as “Okay, but not much more”.</p><h3>How old is Alana in Licorice Pizza?</h3><p>30&nbsp;years (December 15, 1991)</p><h3>Why is Haim in Licorice Pizza?</h3><p><b>She’s referring to director and writer Paul Thomas Anderson</b>, who grew up in nearby Studio City.
