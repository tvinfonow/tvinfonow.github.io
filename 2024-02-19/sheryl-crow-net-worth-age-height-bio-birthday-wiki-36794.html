The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow, but rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after her arrival. Group members Gilbert, David Baerwald, and David Ricketts (both formerly of David & David), Bill Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, released in August 1993. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits. Tuesday Night Music Club featured many of the songs written by Crow’s friends, including the second single, “Leaving Las Vegas”. The album was slow to garner attention, until “All I Wanna Do” became an unexpected smash hit in October 1994. As she later stated in People, she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the L.A. area and used a poem as lyrics in the song. The singles “Strong Enough” and “Can’t Cry Anymore” were also released, with the first song (“Strong Enough”) charting at No.&nbsp;5 on Billboard and “Can’t Cry Anymore” hitting the Top 40. Tuesday Night Music Club went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the U.S. and U.K. during the 1990s.
