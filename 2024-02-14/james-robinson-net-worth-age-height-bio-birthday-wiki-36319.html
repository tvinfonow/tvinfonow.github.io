After such a stellar year, Robinson elected to pass up his senior season and enter the 1993 NBA draft.</p><p align=justify>Robinson was named Mississippi’s Mr. Basketball & was named a McDonald’s All American in the same group that included such notable players as Kenny Anderson, Shaquille O’Neal, Jim Jackson, and Allan Houston. He signed with Alabama, but was ineligible under the NCAA’s Proposition 48 academic entrance guidelines. He redshirted, and after sitting out for a season he started play for the Crimson Tide in the 1991-92 season.
