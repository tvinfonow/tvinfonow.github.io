He met Wayne ‘Silk’ Perry, a notorious gangster and D.C. enforcer, who would later become his bodyguard and hitman. On January 3, 1990, Martinez and accomplice Big Head Gary murdered Rich Porter in The Bronx, New York. Porter had previously sold drugs with Martinez. Martinez believed that Porter was holding back drugs earmarked for him and overcharging him. Porter was lured into a car and shot in the head and several times in the body, killing him. Martinez has apologized to the Porter family for the act.</p><p>Martinez was indicted on federal drug charges in July 1990 with two other men, but the indictment against Martinez was dismissed when he remained a fugitive at the time their trial began November 1991. According to the affidavit, Nathaniel Watkins (Rich Porter’s Cousin), Martinez’s codefendant in the Alexandria case, told the FBI in 1989 he was present when Martinez gave $300,000 to a fellow drug dealer in a Crystal City hotel room and instructed the man to take the money to New York. Watkins told the FBI that the drug dealer rode to New York in a limousine, which he and his girlfriend followed, and they went to a Harlem apartment where they met Martinez, who had flown to New York. On November 7, 1991, Martinez was arrested in Washington D.C. for selling drugs. He was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, various drug charges, and 14 counts of murder, including the murder of D.C drug dealer Michael Anthony Salters aka Fray and Brooklyn drug dealer Demencio Benson. Facing the possibility of either the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, Martinez turned informant and testified against members of his organization. For his testimony against Perry (who received five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole), Martinez was sentenced to 35 years in prison.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alpo Martinez</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dyshod</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drug Dealer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harlem</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Popperazzi Po</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alpo Martinez ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
