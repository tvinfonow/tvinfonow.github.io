Kay’s identical twin, David, died a few weeks after they were born.

At 15 years old, Kay was homeless and turned to small crimes to survive. He soon returned to his home after a false arrest and a near death experience. From there, he pursued a career in music and worked as a regular in night clubs. Prior to forming his own band, it was widely reported that Kay failed an audition to become a singer of The Brand New Heavies.
