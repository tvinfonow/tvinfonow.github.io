As a result of the repeated violations, SMU received the “death penalty” from the NCAA, shutting down the program in 1987 and 1988. Neither James’ recruitment nor his participation in the SMU football program were cited by the NCAA in levying sanctions against SMU.</p><p>By 1982, while the pair continued to alternate possessions at tailback, Dickerson had established himself as the featured back as he carried 232 times for 1,617 yards compared to James running 197 times for 938 yards.
