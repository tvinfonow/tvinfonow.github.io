In 2001, the case was taken to the London High Court, which rejected the Indian government’s request for extradition on the ground that there was no prima facie case against Saifi. In August 2001, the prosecution’s main witness, Mohammed Ali Hussain Shaikh, who had earlier claimed Saifi participated in the murder, eventually claimed that he didn’t know Saifi and had never seen him. Abu Salem also denied Nadeem’s involvement on Indian national television. Saifi was also exonerated by four courts, including the House of Lords in the United Kingdom and the sessions court in Mumbai. Saifi eventually acquired British citizenship, and later moved to Dubai, where he runs a successful perfumery business.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Gulshan Kumar height</b> Not available right now.

Although he had received two threatening calls, on 5 and 8 August 1997, Kumar refused to pay the extortion money. The hired killers, including Rauf and Abdul Rashid, conducted reconnaissance for a month, but did not proceed because of the armed bodyguard. At 10.40&nbsp;am, while returning from the temple, he was confronted by one of the assassins who said: “Bahut puja kar li, ab upar ja ke karna (you have done enough puja, now do it up there).” Initially, Kumar survived and sought shelter in nearby huts, but residents shut their doors.

The police also accused film composer Nadeem Saifi of the music duo Nadeem-Shravan of having paid for the murder due to a personal dispute and fled the country after the murder. However, on 9 January 2001, Abdul Rauf Merchant (known as “Raja”) confessed to being the murderer. On 29 April 2002, Sessions Judge M. L. Tahilyani sentenced Rauf to life imprisonment, stating that he was not imposing the death penalty because the prosecution had failed to prove that Rauf was a contract killer. The police alleged that Saifi paid Abu Salem, a known associate of Dawood Ibrahim, to assassinate Dua and assigned Rauf to the job, but it just so happened that Ibrahim and Abu Salem were already planning on murdering Dua as he had refused to pay protection money to D-Company as part of an extortion attempt. As per his family’s wishes, Gulshan Kumar Dua was cremated in a shamshan (cremation ground) in Delhi.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Gulshan Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Entrepreneur</strong>.
