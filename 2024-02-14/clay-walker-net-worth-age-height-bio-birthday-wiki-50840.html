Of the comparison among the three, Rick Koster wrote in the book Texas Music that Walker’s success came more quickly than that of Chesnutt or Byrd. Kurt Wolff and Orla Duane, authors of Country Music: The Rough Guide, said that he “had loads of youthful energy, a golden Texas twang, and, of course, plenty of boyish good looks.” They also called his music “relatively tame” but said that “his Texas bar-room roots remain clearly visible in his voice and songs.” Regarding Walker’s onstage persona, former Warner Bros. executive Bill Mayne told Billboard magazine in 1997 that Walker has “maintained a low profile” but that he “really touches people and connects.”</p><h2>Clay Walker Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Clay Walker is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.
