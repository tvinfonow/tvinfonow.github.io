In the primary election on June 5, Levin came in second in total votes to Republican State Board of Equalization chairwoman Diane Harkey and advanced to the November general election. This assured that the district would be represented by someone from the Orange County portion of the district, though the 49th is a San Diego district by weight of population. Levin is from San Juan Capistrano, while Harkey is from nearby Dana Point.</p><p>In a commentary published on April 16, 2011, in the Orange County Register, Levin praised California’s legislature for taking “bold steps to put our state … in a leading position for investment and growth” by choosing a clean energy strategy. “There’s clear evidence that clean energy drives job creation and investment even in the midst of a recession,” he wrote.</p><p>Levin served as the executive director of the Democratic Party of Orange County. He later served on the National Finance Committee for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign for President.</p><p>At a town hall event that Issa held on March 11, 2017, Levin publicly confronted Issa and mentioned a book he had sent Issa in 2016 entitled Climate Change for Beginners. Levin charged that Issa’s solution to climate problems “is to build more natural gas plants and to keep the nuclear energy plants online for longer…. I think that’s an unfathomable proposal for a progressive and environmentally-friendly place like San Diego.” On January 10, 2018, Issa announced his retirement.</p><p align=justify>During World War II, his paternal grandfather, Ted Levin, served in the Pacific theater as a gunner with the 867th Bomb Squadron of the U.S. Army Air Forces.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike Levin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mike</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Environmentalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Inglewood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Inglewood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chrissy Levin (m. 2011)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mike Levin ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
