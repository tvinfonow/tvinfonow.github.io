Who is Lisa Madigan dating now & how much money does Lisa Madigan have?</p><h2>Lisa Madigan Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Lisa Madigan</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Lawyer</strong> who was born on <strong>July 30, 1966</strong> in Chicago, Illinois, <strong>United States</strong>. Lisa Murray Madigan, born July 30, 1966, is an American politician and lawyer.&nbsp;She was a member of the Democratic Party and served as the Attorney General of Illinois between 2003 and 2019, becoming the first woman to hold this position.&nbsp;She is the daughter of Michael Madigan who served as the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1997 to 2007.</p><p>Madigan was the first Illinois Attorney General to argue a case before a United States Supreme Court in 2004.&nbsp;Illinois v. Caballes was successfully argued by Madigan, which saw the court affirm the police’s ability to use specially trained dogs to detect illegal drugs during traffic stop stops without the need for a search warrant.</p><p>Madigan was one of many Illinois politicians with strained relationships with now-convicted former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. (See Rod Blagojevich controversies.) Her father Michael Madigan, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives previously had a feud with Blagojevich, as highlighted by TIME magazine. On December 12, 2008, Madigan attracted national attention after filing a motion with the Supreme Court of Illinois to temporarily remove Governor Rod Blagojevich from office and install Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn. Although that court denied that motion without a hearing, Blagojevich was subsequently impeached and removed from office by the Illinois General Assembly, and Quinn was sworn in as governor. Blagojevich was later convicted in Federal court on 18 counts and sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment, based on the blatancy of his attempts to use his office for personal gain. Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court upheld his convictions, on a subsequent appeal, the 7th Circuit threw out 5 of the convictions in 2015, but Blagojevich was resentenced to the same lengthy term of imprisonment.</p><p>In 2008, Madigan was considered a potential candidate for Governor of Illinois or the United States Senate. However, on July 8, 2009, Madigan announced she was running for reelection as Illinois Attorney General instead of seeking higher office in 2010. Although she was also considered a possible replacement for Barack Obama’s Senate seat following his victory in the 2008 presidential election, Madigan described her chances of being appointed as “less than zero.” Instead, Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich appointed Roland Burris to fill that term, which appointment gave rise to the Blagojevich Senate appointment scandal and ultimately led to his federal convictions. Many speculated Madigan was “Senate Candidate #2” in the complaint against Blagojevich, although no wrongdoing on her part was implied.</p><p align=justify>Madigan was elected Attorney General of Illinois in 2002. He narrowly defeated Joe Birkett, who received 50.4%.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lisa Madigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lisa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Madigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawyer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Madigan, Joel Murray, Shirley Madigan</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Pat Byrnes</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rebecca Byrnes, Lucy Byrnes</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lisa Madigan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
