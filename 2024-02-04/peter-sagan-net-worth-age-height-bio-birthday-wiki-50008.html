After missing the move up Bonny Doon on stage 3, he was 17 seconds back. The two stage wins that he took not only moved him into the third place in the general classification but also put him into the jersey of the leader of the points classification. Going into the 7th Stage Time Trial through Los Angeles, he was only 9 seconds back. Even though he had prior success in Prologues, this Time Trial was slightly too long, and he lost 1 minute and 35 seconds on GC going into the final stage. Even though he was dropped out of the select GC group on the last lap of the 20.4 miles (32.8&nbsp;km) circuit, he secured both the Youth Competition and the Points Classification. He ended up 8th in the overall, behind seasoned veterans like Levi Leipheimer, Michael Rogers, David Zabriskie, Chris Horner, and Jens Voigt. Sagan finished fourth in the opening prologue of the 2010 Tour de Suisse, only three seconds behind Fabian Cancellara, but finished almost 11 minutes down in the second stage and didn’t take the start the following day alleging severe fatigue.</p><h2>Peter Sagan Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Peter Sagan is one of the <strong>richest Cyclist</strong> from Slovakia.

The seventh of those result came as a very close photofinish sprint between Sagan and Matteo Trentin, where Sagan had to settle for second by a few millimeters.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cyclist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sagan won his first and second Pro Tour stages during the 2010 Paris–Nice road race. Sagan was not initially nominated for the race, but joined the team after his teammate Maciej Bodnar broke his collarbone. His first stage win was gained on 10 March 2010, when Sagan joined a move initiated by Nicolas Roche on the final climb of the third stage into Aurillac and out-sprinted Roche and Joaquim Rodríguez for the stage win. This stage win also gave Sagan the lead in the points classification, giving him the green jersey. Sagan’s second Pro Tour win came two days later from a solo attack in the fifth stage into Aix-en-Provence. Attacking three kilometres from the finish, on a steep climb, Sagan was able to hold off the Peloton to claim the win. Alongside his two-stage wins, Sagan also finished second in stage two at Limoges and third in stage six into Tourrettes-sur-Loup. The combination of high stage placings and intermediate sprint points won Sagan the points classification for 2010. He finished the race 17th, three minutes and twenty one seconds behind race winner Alberto Contador, who praised the young Slovak and predicted he would be a rival to watch in future races. He also finished eighth in the young rider classification.</p><p>Liquigas selected Sagan for his first Pro Tour road race Tour Down Under in January 2010 at the age of 19. He was involved in a crash during the second stage but kept riding with 17 stitches in his arm and left thigh. In the queen stage to Willunga he joined an attack over the last climb with Cadel Evans, Alejandro Valverde and Luis León Sánchez. The four fought to hold off the sprinters’ group over the next 20 kilometres, with Sánchez taking the win.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Peter Sagan height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Peter <strong>weight</strong> <strong>78 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>78 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the first stage of the Tour de France Sagan came in third. He then won the second stage, which featured a finish on a category 3 climb, to claim the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for the first time in his career. He mentioned that he did not know he had won upon reaching the finish line, thinking more riders from the breakaway had crossed the line before him. Sagan was part of the breakaway on stage 10. He finished second to Michael Matthews and won the most combative award for his efforts. On the very next stage, Sagan broke away with yellow jersey wearer Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and his teammate Maciej Bodnar in the final kilometers. He outsprinted Froome to foil the sprinters’ plans. After the stage, asked why he undertook such a daring move, he said: “We are artists”. Sagan claimed his 3rd victory by winning stage 16 in Bern, beating Alexander Kristoff in a sprint by few centimetres. He finished second to Greipel on the last stage in the Champs Élysées, securing his green jersey. He also was elected “most combative” rider of the whole Tour.</p><p align=justify>Sagan started the 2012 Tour de France by finishing in 53rd place on the Prologue after losing some time in the corners. He won the first stage in Seraing atop a small climb after breaking away with a little more than a kilometre to go with Fabian Cancellara (RadioShack–Nissan) and out sprinting him and Edvald Boasson Hagen (Team Sky). According to Sagan’s SRM file, in the final 1.5&nbsp;km when Cancellara initiated the move, Sagan ramped up his cadence to over 120rpm to stay with him and averaged 493 watts of power in the last 2 minutes 20 seconds of the race. His power output surged to 1,236 watts in the finale, averaging 970 watts in the last 200 metres. On Stage 3, he came atop the final Category 4 climb in Boulogne-sur-Mer sprinting away and leaving the field behind. As he crossed the finish line, which was situated at the end of the 700-metre slope, he made a gesture imitating the run of Forrest Gump. He won again on Stage 6, which had a course suited for a bunch sprint and finished in Metz. He beat pure sprinters André Greipel of Lotto–Belisol and Matthew Goss of the Orica–GreenEDGE squad by a little more than a bike length. He finished the Tour with 3 stage wins and as winner of the points classification, also earning the “most combative” rider award on the mountainous Stage 14. He won a Porsche since he made a bet with the Liquigas management that he could win 2 stages and the points classification.</p><h2>Who is Peter Sagan Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Peter Sagan</strong> married to <strong>Katarína Saganová </strong>.
