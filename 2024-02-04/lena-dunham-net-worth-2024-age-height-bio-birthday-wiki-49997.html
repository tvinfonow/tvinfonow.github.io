American actor producer, director, and writer who received praise for her work in co-creating and starring on HBO’s Girls.&nbsp;She later co-created HBO’s Camping which starred&nbsp;American actress, producer, director, and writer who earned critical acclaim for co-creating and starring in HBO’s Girls. She went on to co-create HBO’s Camping starring <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a>..</p><p>She was a character in the movie This Is 40 with&nbsp;She had a supporting role in the film This Is 40 with <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a>..</p><p>Dunham said Girls reflects a part of the population not portrayed in the 1998 HBO series Sex and the City. “Gossip Girl was teens duking it out on the Upper East Side and Sex and the City was women who [had] figured out work and friends and now want to nail romance and family life. There was this ‘hole-in-between’ space that hadn’t really been addressed,” she said. The pilot intentionally references Sex and the City as producers wanted to make it clear that the driving force behind Girls is that the characters were inspired by the former HBO series and moved to New York to pursue their dreams. Dunham herself says she “revere[s] that show just as much as any girl of my generation”.</p><p>In her book, Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She’s “Learned”, Dunham wrote about being sexually assaulted by an Oberlin College classmate, which resulted in controversy regarding the accuracy of her account and a case of mistaken identity when a former Oberlin College student named Barry (the pseudonym used for Dunham’s alleged attacker in her book) sought legal advice to ensure people didn’t associate him with the content. In the book, Dunham describes “Barry” as a guy who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated Oberlin in 2005. According to the man’s attorney, Aaron Minc, that description warrants enough detail to point a finger at his client. Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a clarification, releasing a statement saying: “Random House, on our own behalf and on behalf of our author, regrets the confusion.”</p><p align=justify>She was a lover of Fun musician&nbsp;Jack Antonoff&nbsp;from 2012 to 2017.&nbsp;The actress’s sister was Grace Dunham.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lena Dunham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lena</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dunham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1986</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Laurie Simmons, Carroll Dunham</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cyrus Grace Dunham</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lena Dunham ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
