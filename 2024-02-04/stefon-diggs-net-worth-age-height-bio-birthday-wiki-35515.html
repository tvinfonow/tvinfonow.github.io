Despite being listed as the team’s No. 2 wide receiver behind Charles Johnson, Diggs still led the team in targets, receptions, and yards as the Vikings were forced to throw more than expected with the Titans bottling up the running game. In Week 2, Diggs posted another stellar performance against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday Night Football. With the Packers stacking the box to stop the running game, Diggs exploited man-to-man coverage from second-year cornerback Damarious Randall and became the focal point of the offense, playing a key role in the Vikings’ 17–14 win over the Packers as he finished the game with career-highs in both catches with nine and receiving yards with 182. This game was Sam Bradford’s first as a Viking, and the team’s first in the new U.S. Bank Stadium.

After Week 2, Diggs was the leader in receiving yards in the NFL. In the Vikings’ overtime loss against the Detroit Lions in Week 9, Diggs set a personal-best with 13 catches for 80 yards, which passed Randy Moss and Percy Harvin (10 apiece) for receptions against the Lions.
