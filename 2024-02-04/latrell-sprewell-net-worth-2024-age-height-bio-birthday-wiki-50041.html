Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Sprewell moved into the Knicks’ starting lineup for the 1999–2000 season at small forward, and averaged 18.6 points, helping the Knicks to a 50–32 record good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference led by Sprewell, Ewing and shooting guard Allan Houston. The Knicks navigated past the Toronto Raptors in three hard-fought games and the Miami Heat in seven even harder-fought games in the first two rounds of the playoffs, en route to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers. But their quest for back-to-back NBA Finals appearances came to an end when they were defeated by the Pacers in 6 games in the Eastern Conference Finals. Sprewell averaged 19.7 ppg in the series, and the Knicks gave him a five-year/$62 million contract extension.</p><h2>Latrell Sprewell Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Latrell Sprewell is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Latrell Sprewell</b>'s net worth <strong>$50 Thousand</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>His collegiate journey began with Three Rivers Community College, later transferring to University of Alabama before he was selected 24th overall in the Warriors in the year 1992.</p><p align=justify>In a game played in 2003 against the Los Angeles Clippers, he scored 9 of nine three-pointers, scoring 38 points during the game.</p><p align=justify>Latrell Fontaine Sprewell (born September 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Golden State Warriors, the New York Knicks, and the Minnesota Timberwolves in the NBA. During his basketball career, Sprewell received four NBA All-Star selections and an All-NBA First Team selection; he also helped the Knicks reach the 1999 NBA Finals and the Timberwolves to the 2004 Western Conference finals. Despite his accomplishments, his career was overshadowed by a 1997 incident in which he choked coach P. J. Carlesimo during a practice, which ultimately resulted in a 68-game suspension.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$50 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Many pundits felt that signing the volatile Sprewell was too big a gamble for the Knicks to take, but Sprewell himself vowed he was a changed man. The Knicks, who at the time still revolved around veteran All-Star center Patrick Ewing, narrowly qualified for the 1999 playoffs, making the field as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks navigated past the Miami Heat, Atlanta Hawks and finally the Indiana Pacers, making it as the first eighth seed in NBA history to the 1999 NBA Finals, where they met the San Antonio Spurs, who beat them in five games although Sprewell enjoyed a good series for the most part, averaging 26.0 ppg. He tallied 35 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Knicks’ 78-77 Game 5 loss, and was subsequently featured on the cover of the September 1999 issue of SLAM Magazine.</p><p>Due to the NBA lockout, Sprewell did not play again until February 1999, after the Warriors traded him to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. Sprewell played 37 games for the Knicks that season, playing off the bench in all but four games.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Latrell Sprewell height</b> <strong>6 ft 5 in</strong> Latrell <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 5 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A significant blemish on Sprewell’s career was an incident that took place on December 1, 1997, when he attacked head coach P. J. Carlesimo during a Warriors practice. When Carlesimo yelled at Sprewell to make crisper passes (specifically asking him to “put a little mustard” on a pass), Sprewell responded that he was not in the mood for criticism and told the coach to keep his distance. When Carlesimo approached, Sprewell threatened to kill him and dragged him backwards by his throat, choking him for 7–10 seconds before his teammates and assistant coaches pulled Sprewell off his coach. Sprewell returned about 20 minutes later after showering and changing and again accosted Carlesimo. He landed a glancing blow at Carlesimo’s right cheek before being dragged away again by the assistant coaches. It was not his first violent incident with the Warriors; in 1995, Sprewell fought with teammate Jerome Kersey and returned to practice carrying a two-by-four, and reportedly threatened to return with a gun. In a 1993 practice, Sprewell fought with Byron Houston, who was 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell and had what many teammates described as a Mike Tyson-like demeanor and physique.</p><p align=justify>Prior to the 2002–03 season, Sprewell reported to training camp with a broken hand, which he claimed occurred when he slipped on his yacht; the Knicks fined him a record $250,000 for failing to report the incident to them. He then sued the New York Post for claiming he had broken his hand in a fight. Sprewell ultimately lost the lawsuit against the New York Post.</p><h2>Who is Latrell Sprewell Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Latrell Sprewell</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

In 2001–02 Sprewell averaged 19.4 ppg, including 49 points in a game against the Boston Celtics, one of three times he scored 40 or more points that season; but it was not enough as the Knicks would miss the playoffs for the first time in 15 years.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Latrell Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Basketball Player</strong>.
