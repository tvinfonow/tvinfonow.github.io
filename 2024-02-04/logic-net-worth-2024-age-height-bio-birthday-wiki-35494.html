In 2009, Logic performed under the stage name “Psychological” with Logic describing the name as “one name that really stuck [with me]. I just loved this word because it was about the mind and I knew that’s what I wanted my music to consist of; something that really challenges the mind”. He released an unofficial mixtape titled Psychological – Logic: The Mixtape under his original stage name. The mixtape allowed Logic to serve as the opening act for artists like Pitbull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman, and Ludacris at various shows all over Maryland.
