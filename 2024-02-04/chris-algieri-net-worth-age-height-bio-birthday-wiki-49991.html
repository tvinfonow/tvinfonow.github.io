Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Chris Algieri's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Chris Algieri's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>After proving himself in the Provodnikov fight, Algieri was given a big shot as he fought legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao on November 23, 2014 in Macau, for the latter’s WBO Welterweight title, it was Algieri’s first fight outside the State of New York. Algieri was stripped of his belt at 140 as WBO rules mandate a fighter of theirs can only hold belts in one division at a time. Algieri was a big underdog coming in, and in a relatively one-sided bout, Pacquiao knocked Algieri down six times and made him tumble repeatedly en route to defeating him via one-sided unanimous decision, ending Algieri’s undefeated streak.</p><h2>Chris Algieri Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Chris Algieri is one of the <strong>richest Boxer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Chris Algieri</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He began training in Chinese Kenpo at the age of 10 and went on to receive a degree in healthcare science from Stony Brook University.</p><p align=justify>As a kickboxer he won the World Kickboxing Association Super Welterweight Championships.</p><p align=justify>In early December 2018, it was reported that Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn was looking to match WBO light welterweight champion Maurice Hooker (25-0-1, 19 KOs) with more credible opponents in 2019. Hearn planned for Algieri and Jorge Linares to fight in separate bouts on his January 18, 2019 DAZN card. Later that month, Boxing Scene announced Algieri would fight in a 10-round bout against 28-year-old Danny Gonzalez (17–1–1, 7 KOs), who was on a 3-fight win streak since suffering his sole loss. Gonzalez and Algieri were former sparring partners. The card would take place at the Hulu Theater in New York City. In what was considered a close bout, Algieri defeated Gonzalez via unanimous decision after 10 rounds. The three judges scored the bout 98–92, 97–93, and 96–94 in favour of Algieri. The decision came with boos from the crowd, who felt the scores did not reflect the fight. Algieri started the fight with his jab, keeping Gonzalez at a distance, this was until Gonzalez got through and managed to cause a cut under Algieri’s left eye. Seeing this as motivation, Gonzalez tried to pile on pressure, but was only able to land no more than two shots at a time. In round 10, Gonzalez managed to trap Algieri but did not land any clean shots until Algieri was able to break free. Speaking to DAZN, after the bout, Algieri said, “I am my biggest critic and this performance wasn’t my best. I got the win and I am moving on […] I felt a little off today. You go back to the drawing board and look to come back better.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On June 14, 2014 Algieri got the chance of a lifetime as he faced and defeated the newly crowned WBO junior welterweight champion Ruslan Provodnikov, headlining on HBO’s “Boxing After Dark” card at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Algieri was seen as a warm-up fight for Provodnikov, which seemed to be the case as early on Algieri was dropped and hurt twice, with his eye swelling grotesquely, essentially blinding him for the rest of the fight, it all seemed to be over. However, Algieri fought back and began to box for the remainder of the fight, using his strong jab to keep his opponent back and moved on the outside, avoiding his Russian counterparts big looping shots. The bout went the full 12 rounds and Algieri won via split decision to become the new WBO junior welterweight champion. Algieri received his biggest purse at the time, $100,000 for the bout. Algieri landing 288 of 993 punches (29%), 177 of 427 (41%) power shots. Provodnikov landed 205 of his 776 punches thrown (26%), which included 164 of 434 power shots (38%). Many media outlets either had Provodnikov winning wide or Algieri winning a close decision. The fight generated high ratings for Algieri’s HBO debut, averaging 1.046 million viewers, and peaking at 1.1 million viewers.</p><p>Algieri turned pro in 2008, and put together a record of 18–0 with 8 knockouts. Most fights, he moved between light welterweight and welterweight. On February 14, 2014, Algieri won a unanimous ten-round decision over Emmanuel Taylor, an IBF number four ranked contender, at the Paramount Theatre in Huntington, Long Island, New York, to enter the world rankings.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Chris Algieri height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Chris <strong>weight</strong> <strong>Light welterweight; Welterweight</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Light welterweight; Welterweight</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As an amateur, Algieri won the USKBA Northeast Championship defeating Kyle Murray. Algieri later turned professional, and won the International Sport Karate Association Welterweight and World Kickboxing Association Super Welterweight Championships, compiling a 20–0 record as a world kickboxing champion before retiring to become a professional boxer.</p><p align=justify>On April 3, 2015, Amir Khan announced via his wife’s YouTube channel that he had agreed to a May 30 welterweight bout with Algieri in New York. The fight was later finalized on April 15, and subsequently set for May 29 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Algieri coming off the Pacquiao loss was seen as an easy touch for Khan by many. But with his new trainer John David Jackson, Algieri hatched a fight plan to be aggressive and apply pressure in the bout, when he usually fights on the outside with a strong jab. He entered the bout weighing more than Khan, and in the fight many commented on how much Algieri had improved since the Pacquiao fight, and that he looked the stronger and fitter of the two. Algieri instantly began cutting down the ring and had Khan backing up fast and unable to land his quick combinations. Algieri, who is not really known as a puncher was able to rock Khan with a big shot early on, and Algieri chased Khan the whole night, landing big punches in every round and finished the night strongly. Khan went on to win the fight via unanimous decision after 12 rounds of boxing, many believing him to win widely on the cards as he was able to steal many of the rounds in the last 10 seconds. Algieri however, believed that he had, in fact, won the bout. Khan made $1.5 million and Algieri earned a $500,000 purse. The fight, which took place on Spike, averaged 1 million viewers and peaked at 1.2 million.</p><h2>Who is Chris Algieri Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Chris Algieri</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
