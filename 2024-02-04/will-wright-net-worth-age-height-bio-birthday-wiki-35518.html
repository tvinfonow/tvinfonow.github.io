SimCity (1989) was a hit and has been credited as one of the most influential computer games ever made. Wright himself has been widely featured in several computer magazines—particularly PC Gamer, which has listed Wright in its annual ‘Game Gods’ feature, alongside such notables as Roberta Williams and Peter Molyneux.</p><p>Following the success of SimCity, Wright designed SimEarth (1990) and SimAnt (1991). He co-designed SimCity 2000 (1993) with Fred Haslam and in the meantime Maxis produced other “Sim” games. Wright’s next game was SimCopter (1996). Although none of these games were as successful as SimCity, they further cemented Wright’s reputation as a designer of “software toys”—games that cannot be won or lost, but played indefinitely. In 1992, Wright moved to Orinda, California.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Will Wright height</b> Not available right now.

While living in New York City he purchased an Apple II+. Wanting to implement Conway’s Game of Life on it caused Wright to teach himself Applesoft BASIC, Pascal, and assembly language. As others like Bill Budge and Nasir Gebelli were already producing multiple Apple video games, Wright decided to develop for the newer Commodore 64. His first game was the helicopter action game Raid on Bungeling Bay (1984).</p><p align=justify>Maxis went public in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright had been thinking about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on individual people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims would be based on Wright’s focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright’s idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis’s employees had been laid off.</p><h2>Who is Will Wright Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Will Wright</strong> married to <strong>Anya Zavarzina</strong>.
