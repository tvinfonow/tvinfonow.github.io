Who is Court McGee dating now & how much money does Court McGee have?</p><h2>Court McGee Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Court McGee</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>MMA Fighter</strong> who was born on <strong>December 12, 1984</strong> in Utah, <strong>United States</strong>. Southpaw welterweight made his debut in the UFC when he won the season 2010 on The Ultimate Fighter.</p><p>He was crowned The Ultimate Fighter under the guidance of the captain&nbsp;He won The Ultimate Fighter under the leadership of captain <a href=#>Chuck Liddell</a>…</p><p>Court McGee participated in high school wrestling at Layton High School placing 6th in the 5A State Division in 2002 and 3rd in the 5A State Division in 2003, under Mike Hansen. McGee also holds a background in karate, in which he has amassed over 100 kumite. In the early 2000s, McGee started taking painkillers in an attempt to find relief from an injury and began hanging out with the wrong crowd, a situation that would lead McGee to become addicted to heroin and cocaine. Following an overdose in which McGee was declared clinically deceased for eight minutes, he was resuscitated and as a result of the damage caused from temporary death to the brain, he had to learn how to walk and talk again. After rehab and getting himself cleaned up from substance abuse, McGee returned to Layton High School to become an assistant wrestling coach. He later picked up Brazilian jiu-jitsu and boxing, and eventually transitioned into competing in MMA professionally.</p><p>McGee is a former heroin addict and in 2005, he was declared clinically dead after overdosing on heroin at his cousin’s house before he was resuscitated. McGee had to learn to walk, speak and function again after his first overdose. McGee said that his path into drug and alcohol abuse began when he started to hang out with “the wrong people – drinking, partying.” After suffering an injury to his clavicle and elbow, McGee became dependent to painkillers, which he later mixed with alcohol. McGee had taken cocaine and heroin before overdosing. After his near-death experience, McGee suffered a couple of relapses. On an episode of The Ultimate Fighter, McGee said “I took one drink in Vegas and I ended up in Iowa four days later with no pants on and a long sleeve shirt, looking for meth.” I was strung out, the heroin addict, the drunk, the liar, the cheat, the thief. That’s who I thought I was. I never thought I was going to amount to nothing.}}</p><p align=justify>There are two boys, Isaac and Crew, together with his partner Chelsea McGee.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Court McGee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Court</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>McGee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mma Fighter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Utah</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chelsea Mcgee</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Court McGee ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
