According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Gary Patterson</b>'s net worth <strong>$12 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a linebacker and safety on the team of Kansas State University from 1980 until 1981.</p><p align=justify>He was instrumental in helping Texas Christian University secure a record of 116-36 during the first 13 years as head coach of the team.</p><p align=justify>Gary Allen Patterson (born February 13, 1960) is an American football coach and former player. He is the head football coach at Texas Christian University and the winningest coach in Horned Frogs’ history. Patterson has led the TCU Horned Frogs to six conference championships—one Conference USA title in 2002; four Mountain West Conference titles in 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2011; and one Big 12 Conference title in 2014—and nine bowl game victories—including victories in the 2011 Rose Bowl and 2014 Peach Bowl. His 2010 squad finished the season undefeated at 13–0 after a 21–19 Rose Bowl victory over the Wisconsin Badgers on New Year’s Day 2011, and ranked second in the final tallying of both major polls. He is currently the second longest tenured coach with one FBS program, only behind Kirk Ferentz of the University of Iowa.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Patterson led the 2009 Horned Frogs to a perfect 12–0 regular season record, a Mountain West Conference championship, a #4 final BCS ranking, and an invitation to the 2010 Fiesta Bowl—their first major bowl appearance in 51 years. They ultimately fell by a score of 17–10 to undefeated #6 Boise State. The 2009 Horned Frogs became the second “BCS Buster” from the Mountain West Conference (and the fourth, overall). For much of the season, they were a serious threat to “crash” the 2010 BCS National Championship Game. However, any chance of the Horned Frogs playing for the national championship ended on the final day of the season, when Cincinnati defeated Pitt on an epic fourth-quarter rally. This assured that two teams from Automatic Qualifying conferences would finish the regular season undefeated (whoever won the 2009 SEC Championship Game would have also finished undefeated). Patterson was named the 2009 AP Coach of the Year, becoming the first head coach of a BCS non-AQ conference team to win the award. He won a total of seven national “Coach of the Year” awards in 2009 in addition to being named the Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year for the second time (his third conference “Coach of the Year” award, overall).</p><p>The following year, Patterson led the 2010 Horned Frogs to a second consecutive undefeated regular season and a #3 final BCS ranking. TCU received the first Rose Bowl invitation offered to a team from a non-AQ conference during the BCS era. The Horned Frogs won the 2011 Rose Bowl, 21–19, over Wisconsin to cap off only the second undefeated and untied season in school history. When TCU entered the Big 12 Conference in 2012, Patterson was faced with 7-6 2012 and 4-8 2013 seasons, but turned it around and led the Horned Frogs to their first Big 12 title in 2014, going 11-1, finishing in the top 5 of polls, with impressive wins over #4 Oklahoma, Minnesota, #7 Kansas State and scoring 82 points behind a 31-point third quarter against Texas Tech.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Gary Patterson height</b> Not available right now.

His teams have won at least 10 games in a season eight times. Only three times have they failed to reach a bowl, in 2004, 2013, and 2019. Patterson’s Frogs have earned a spot in the year-end top 25 ten times, counting his partial season as head coach in 2000. In 2005, Patterson led the Frogs to the Mountain West Conference championship in their first season as a member. Over the course of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, the Frogs won four consecutive games against Big 12 Conference opponents, with three of the victories coming on the road. He tandem jumped with the Army Golden Knights prior to the 2005 TCU vs. Army football game, crossing skydiving off his bucket list. Patterson was named the 2005 Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year. In January 2007, Patterson turned down a head coaching offer from the University of Minnesota worth over $2 million per year.</p><p align=justify>In August 2016, TCU announced Patterson’s contract had been extended through 2022, with an annual base salary of $4.75 million. The Frogs went 6-7 (4-5) in 2016 losing 31-23 to Georgia in the Liberty Bowl. In 2017, TCU opened with a 63-0 drubbing of Jackson State. They dismantled Arkansas 28-7 in Week 2. In Week 3, the #20 Frogs beat SMU in the Iron Skillet Rivalry 56-36. In week 4, the #16 Frogs upset #6 Oklahoma State 44-31 behind a 31 carry 160 yard 3 TD performance from HB Darius Anderson.

In Week 13, the #12 Frogs beat Baylor 45-22 to finish 10-2 (7-2). They made the inaugural Big XII Title Game as #11 but lost 41-17 to #3 Oklahoma.

TCU beat Stanford 39-37 to win the Alamo Bowl.</p><h2>Who is Gary Patterson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Gary Patterson</strong> married to <strong>Kelsey Patterson (m. 2004)</strong>.
