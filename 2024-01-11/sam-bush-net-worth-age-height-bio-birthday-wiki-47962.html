Mandolin player widely believed to be responsible for being the first to create the bluegrass subgenre referred to as Newgrass.&nbsp;He was awarded Mandolin player of the year by the International Bluegrass Music Association in 1990 1991, 1992, and 2007.</p><p>He also shared his Album of the Year Grammy along with musicians like the guitarist&nbsp;He shared his Album of the Year Grammy with artists like fiddle player <a href=#>Alison Krauss</a>..</p><p>Born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Bush was exposed to country and bluegrass music at an early age through his father Charlie’s record collection, and later by the Flatt & Scruggs television show. Buying his first mandolin at the age of 11, his musical interest was further piqued when he attended the inaugural Roanoke, VA Bluegrass Festival in 1965. As a teen Bush took first place three times in the junior division of the National Oldtime Fiddler’s Contest in Weiser, ID. He joined guitarist Wayne Stewart, his mentor and music teacher during Sam’s teen years, and banjoist Alan Munde (later of Country Gazette) and the three recorded an instrumental album, Poor Richard’s Almanac, in 1969. In the spring of 1970, Bush attended the Fiddlers Convention at Union Grove, NC, and was inspired by the rock-flavored progressive bluegrass of the New Deal String Band. Later that year, he moved to Louisville and joined the Bluegrass Alliance. In the fall of 1971, the band dissolved and reformed as the New Grass Revival.</p><p>The New Grass Revival went through numerous personnel changes, with Bush remaining as the sole original member.
