Easton reprised his One Life to Live role of John McBain from March 2012 – March 2013 and his Port Charles/General Hospital role of Caleb Morley from February to March 2013. Easton exited his General Hospital roles due to legal issues regarding Prospect Park’s revival of One Life to Live. Easton was slated to return to General Hospital at some point, possibly in a new role, since at the time Prospect Park currently held the rights to all One Life to Live characters. TV Guide reported that because ABC did not want to risk any further legal disputes with Prospect Park concerning the characters, the only way to avoid such disputes might be to have the former One Life to Live actors portray “characters that in no way resemble the current ones” in order to stay on General Hospital. Easton returned to General Hospital in May 2013 as Dr. Silas Clay. On July 29, 2015, it was confirmed that Easton would exit General Hospital.</p><h2>Who is Michael Easton Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Michael Easton</strong> married to <strong>Ginevra Arabia (m. 2004)</strong>.
