Cunningham II was born in Las Vegas to Randall Cunningham (nee De Jager), on January 4, 1996.&nbsp;Cunningham II is the son of a 2-time All-American punter, and a 4-time Pro Bowl quarterback Cunningham.&nbsp;He is also the nephew of Sam Cunningham, College Football Hall of Fame runningback.&nbsp;He also has two Cunningham uncles, A.C. (and Bruce), who both played Division I football.&nbsp;Felicity Cunningham, Felicity’s mother, is a native South African ballerina who worked as a professional dancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem.&nbsp;Vashti Cunningham is his younger sister and was a World Indoor Champion. She signed a contract with Nike as a professional while she was still in high school.&nbsp;Christian Cunningham, his brother, passed away at the age of 2.&nbsp;Cunningham was also a high school competitor in long jump.</p><p>Cunningham had intended to compete in track and football in college starting in his junior year of high school. However, UNLV, his father’s alma maternity, doesn’t have a men’s track program.&nbsp;Baylor made his first offer and he gave him the nickname RC2, a reference RG3.&nbsp;He wanted to break the national high school high jump record of 7′ 5.75″ (2.28m) and to become an Olympic high jumper. However, the qualifying jump for the 2012 Olympic team was 2.28m (7 ft 5/4 in).&nbsp;2.29m (7 ft 6 inches) was the qualifying standard for 2016 Olympics.</p><p>Due to NIAA rules which require a transfer student to wait a year before participating in athletic activities, Randall II was required to sit out his sophomore year in both football and track and field at Bishop Gorman. Then, he backed up four-time state champion starting quarterback Anu Solomon as a junior. That season, he compiled 298 yards and two touchdowns on 21–32 passing with four interceptions and added 42 rushes for 483 yards and seven touchdowns. By his junior year, his 40-yard dash speed was laser-timed at 4.6 seconds. As a senior, he inherited a team that Solomon had led to four consecutive state championships. Despite not starting until his senior season, he entered the year with football scholarship offers from Mississippi State, LSU, Baylor, Syracuse, Arizona State, Utah and UNLV. USA Today predicted that Baylor and LSU may be favorites because of their strong track programs.</p><p>In football, he led Gorman to its fifth consecutive Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) state championship in 2013 and declined numerous Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) scholarship offers as well as an offer to play football at Yale University. He is the son of retired National Football League quarterback Randall Cunningham, nephew of retired NFL fullback Sam Cunningham and older brother of World Champion Vashti Cunningham.</p><p align=justify>Cunningham was second in the 13-14 age category at the USATF National Junior Olympics on August 1, 2010. His high jump of 5′ 8.75 inches (1.75m) placed him second.&nbsp;Cunningham won the May 20, 2011, NIAA AAAA high jumping championship with a leap of 6′ 7″ (2.01 m) as a freshman.&nbsp;After transferring, he was a sophomore and sat out the NIAA competition.&nbsp;His father’s high jump was 6.9 inches (2.06m) in high school.&nbsp;Cunningham set the USATF 15-16 youth age group outdoor track & field record with a jump height of 2.16m (7 ft 1.0in) on June 24, 2012.&nbsp;Cunningham won August 2012 National AAU Junior Olympic Games High Jump with a leap of 7′ 2″ (2.18m).&nbsp;Cunningham actually won the 15-16 age category with a height 6′ 9″ (2.06m).&nbsp;Johnnie Bartley held the Junior Olympic age-group record at 7 feet 0 in (2.13m) since 1986. But Cunningham kept going past his winning height to set a new Junior Olympic record.&nbsp;He had already cleared 7ft (2.13m) by April 11, 2013, which was his third season as a junior. This height was also the NIAA state championship record for that season.&nbsp;He jumped 7 feet 3.25 inches (2.22 m) at the NIAA state championships on May 18, 2013. This was the highest high jump by a high school student that year.&nbsp;He was awarded the Nevada Track & Field Gatorade player of the year award.&nbsp;He was second or third in the AAU Junior Olympics of August 2013. His height was either 6’10” (2.08m) or 7′ (2.13m), depending upon the source.&nbsp;He made a verbal commitment on January 3, 2014 to the USC Trojans track and field team. He declined over 30 football scholarship opportunities.&nbsp;At the 2014 Mt.&nbsp;SAC (Mt.&nbsp;San Antonio College) Relays. He set the American high school season record for boys at 7′ 2″ (2.18m) the same day that his sister Vashti did it for girls at 6′ 2″, (1.88m)&nbsp;Bryant O’Georgia from Arizona was one quarter inch ahead of Cunningham in May.&nbsp;Cunningham was first with a 6′ 11″ high jump (2.11 m) followed by a 22-foot 8.25 inch (6.92 m), and was second with a 22-foot 8.25 inch long jump (6.92 m).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Randall Cunningham II</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Randall</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>II</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1996</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Las Vegas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nevada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Randall Cunningham</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Vashti Cunningham</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Randall Cunningham II ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
