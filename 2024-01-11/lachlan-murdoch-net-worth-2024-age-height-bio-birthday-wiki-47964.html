The unexplained departure apparently dashed News Corp. Chief executive Rupert Murdoch’s hopes that his son would one day take over as CEO of the global media empire, which includes the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, the Fox television network, several satellite broadcasters, and newspapers in Britain, Australia, and the United States. Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News Channel, was named chairman of News Corp’s group of television stations to succeed Murdoch junior. Media speculated that his brother, James Murdoch, the chief executive of UK satellite TV company BSkyB may succeed Rupert Murdoch. During his time as an executive at News Corp, Murdoch was the Deputy Chief Operating Officer of News Corporation (now 21st Century Fox). He had oversight of HarperCollins and the company’s lines of business in Australia, including REA.

He was appointed to the News Corp board in 1996.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Lachlan Murdoch height</b> Not available right now.

The company later emerged as Australia’s market leader in online real estate advertising, and in 2014 was assessed as worth more than $3.6&nbsp;billion to News Corp. With a personal interest in Australian rugby league, on 30 March 1995 Murdoch was at the first Super League meeting in the Atanaskovic Hartnell offices in Sydney.
