She made many television appearances in the late 1980s and 1990s on such episodic shows as Spenser: For Hire, All My Children, and Brooklyn Bridge. About playing the mother, in her late thirties, of David Schwimmer’s character in the short-lived 1994 FOX sitcom, Monty, she said, “you don’t really start playing moms in Hollywood until you’re in your 40s, and usually the kids are almost your age! When I played Schwimmer’s mother, I was 37 and he was, I think, 28. . . that happens a lot in TV and film; you really do end up being close in age to your child, which is nonsensical.” In 1996, Burton won a Daytime Emmy award for her performance as a mother dying of breast cancer in the ABC Afterschool Special, ‘Notes For My Daughter’. More recently, she made guest appearances as recurring characters on Law & Order, The Practice, The West Wing, Judging Amy and Medium.
