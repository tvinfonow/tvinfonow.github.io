Who is James Wood dating now & how much money does James Wood have?</p><h2>James Wood Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>James Wood</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Composer</strong> who was born on <strong>May 27, 1953</strong> in Cambridgeshire, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. James Wood was born 27 May 1953 in Barton-on-Sea (England) and is a British conductor, composer, and former percussionist.&nbsp;Wood studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger from 1971 to 1972, before he went on to study music at Cambridge University. He was the organ scholar of Sidney Sussex College between 1972 and 1975.&nbsp;Wood graduated from Cambridge and went on to study conducting and percussion at the Royal Academy of Music in London, from 1975 to 1976.&nbsp;Wood began a triple career as a percussionist, composer, and conductor after spending another year with Nicholas Cole.</p><p>Wood began to be invited to conduct from European ensembles in the mid-1990s. These included l’Itineraire and Ensemble InterContemporain. He also received invitations from musikFabrik, Champ d’Action and several choirs such as the Netherlands Radio Choir and Collegium Vocale Gent.&nbsp;He worked closely with Karlheinz Stockhausen in 2002 on the Engel-Prozessionen world premiere, which he conducted at Amsterdam Concertgebouw together with the Netherlands Radio Choir.&nbsp;He conducted the same work in Cologne Opera’s production, Sonntag aus Licht, later in 2011.</p><p>With NLCC Wood undertook numerous CD recordings, many of which were world premiere recordings: these included music by Eric Bergman (Chandos), Lili Boulanger (Hyperion), Ruth Crawford Seeger (Deutsche Grammophon), Giacinto Scelsi (Una Corda), Frank Denyer (Continuum), Iannis Xenakis (Hyperion) and James Wood himself (Continuum and NMC). They also recorded music of Poulenc and Janacek for Hyperion, and Dallapiccola for Erato. Their 1990 Hyperion recording of Stravinsky’s Les Noces (performed in collaboration with the choir of the Institute of the Arts, Voronezh, Russia) was voted ‘best available recording’ in BBC Radio 3’s ‘Building a Library’ in September 2000. They also collaborated with Oliver Knussen and the London Sinfonietta in a recording of Stravinsky’s The Flood and Requiem Canticles (Deutsche Grammophon). In 1988 Wood helped devise a BBC2 documentary about Lili Boulanger – ‘Whom the Gods loved’ directed by Hilary Boulding. The film culminated in performances of the Pie Jesu as well as Boulanger’s monumental Du Fond de l’Abime with Linda Hirst, Martyn Hill, New London Chamber Choir and the London Sinfonietta.</p><p>Ever conscious of the fact that electronic music provided a perfect medium in which to explore his love for both microtonality and new sounds, Wood decided to immerse himself more fully in this world, and in 1996 undertook a major project at IRCAM in Paris. He worked together with Carl Faia on a new work for Alphorn, MIDI-cowbells and electronics – Mountain Language – from 1997 to 1998. This marked the start of a series of works involving electronics, including Séance (1996), Jodo (1999), Autumn Voices (2001) and the opera, Hildegard (2002–2006).</p><p align=justify>Wood began to experiment with microtonality in the years 1983-2004.&nbsp;Ho shang Yao (Songs by the River), Wood created simple quartertone extensions for marimbas and glockenspiel.&nbsp;After further experiments, such as Spirit Festival, Stoicheia, and the quartertone marimba concerto, VenancioMbande talking to the trees, he realized that any future for microtonality had to include the development of microtonal fixed pitch instruments (for example, keyboard percussion instruments), and the adoption of acceptable designs by commercial instrument makers.&nbsp;The Dutch company Adams took up his second prototype quartertone marmba extension design. They produce them on special orders.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James Wood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cambridgeshire</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>James Wood ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, James Wood's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update James Wood's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Since 2008 Wood has directed the Tenso Young Composers Workshops, designed to help and encourage young composers from all over Europe in composing for chamber choir.</p><h2>James Wood Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>James Wood is one of the <strong>richest Composer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>James Wood</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was appointed as the Schola Cantorum conductor in Oxford in 1977. This post he held until 1981. He also founded the New London Chamber Choir immediately after. The choir was his principal conductor for 26 years before he moved to Germany in 2007.</p><p align=justify>Wood, in addition to his work as a composer and conductor, was also active as an percussionist in numerous contemporary ensembles, including Lontano (director Alan Hacker), Matrix, Endymion, Dreamtiger, Endymion, Endymion, and Lontano.&nbsp;Friedrich Ferdinand Hommel, the new director at Darmstadter Ferienkurse noticed him and invited him to become Professor of Percussion starting in 1982.&nbsp;This position he held until 1994, during the Hommel years.&nbsp;He pioneered many new pieces for solo percussion and percussion ensembles, including his own Choroi Kai Thaliai (1982), Ho Shan Yao (1983), and Rogosanti (1986). He toured extensively with Sara Stowe, the soprano, and John Whiting, the sound engineer.&nbsp;All of these pieces were recorded and released on CD by Continuum.&nbsp;He was the artistic director of the London Percussion Festivals 1988 and 1990. Hilary Boulding directed two BBC TV documentaries about percussion in the BBC2 series “Music in Camera”.</p><p align=justify>This experience led to the idea of engaging in some kind of research and training programme for instrumentalists in microtonal performance, and so in 1990 Wood founded London’s first Centre for Microtonal Music, and its ensemble, Critical Band. The purpose of the Microtonal Centre was to research instrumental microtonal playing techniques, to teach these to young musicians whilst at the same time educating composers in the historical, theoretical, emotional and practical implications of microtonality. The initiative involved the collaboration of the Society for the Promotion of New Music (SPNM), the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and the Barbican Centre in London, which held a Weekend of Microtonal Music, ‘In Tune?’, in 1990, 1991 and 1992. Aside from its presence at the ‘In Tune?’ Festivals, the ensemble ‘Critical Band’ undertook several recordings, concerts and tours, including a CD of three of Wood’s own compositions: Venancio Mbande talking with the Trees, Phainomena and Two men meet, each presuming the other to be from a distant planet (NMC-D044). This latter work was also premiered by Critical Band at the 1995 BBC Proms (September 11). But since the late 1990s both the Centre for Microtonal Music and Critical Band became disbanded through lack of funding.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>From 2008 until 2011, he undertook the reconstruction of the two missing voices of the Sacrae Cantiones Liber Secundus of the sixteenth-century Italian composer, Carlo Gesualdo. This massive undertaking culminated in his recording of the complete set with Vocalconsort Berlin for Harmonia Mundi. Released in February 2013, the CD (HMC 902123) went on to receive universal critical acclaim, and was awarded the ECHO Klassik Preis in the category ‘Choir Recording of the Year’ in October 2013.</p><p>But outside the realm of purely fixed-pitch instruments, Wood was also active in writing microtonal music for conventional instruments – this led to one of Wood’s largest-scale works, Oreion, for large orchestra. Commissioned by the BBC for the 1989 Proms (9 August), this 30-minute work was performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Wood himself. The work was subsequently selected for performance at the 1991 ISCM Festival in Zürich, performed this time by the Krakow Radio Orchestra, again conducted by the composer.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>James Wood height</b> Not available right now.

Since then Wood has continued to work regularly with choirs and ensembles throughout Europe, notably the Netherlands Radio Choir, musikFabik, Berlin Radio Choir, RIAS Kammerchor and the MDR Rundfunkchor in Leipzig, as well as remaining prolific as a composer. Notable performances include Luigi Nono’s Caminantes Ayacucho with the Netherlands Radio Choir and Netherlands Radio Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra at the 2008 Holland Festival; his training of the Vienna State Opera Chorus for Nono’s Al gran sole carico d’amore at the 2009 Salzburg Festival, conducted by Ingo Metzmacher; the first ever performance with live pianolist (Rex Lawson) of Theo Verbey’s completion of Stravinsky’s 1919 version Les Noces with musikFabrik and RIAS Kammerchor at the Berlin Philharmonie in 2013; and the German premiere of Wood’s own Tongues of Fire (for large chorus and percussion quartet) with the MDR Rundfunkchor in Leipzig in November 2014.</p><p align=justify>One of Friedrich Hommel’s principal aims as Director of the Darmstädter Ferienkurse had always been to establish the courses as a centre for the rapidly evolving world of percussion. To this end he commissioned Wood to write a large-scale work for percussion ensemble which would make full use of the large number of talented young percussionists from all over the world who were coming to Darmstadt for the summer courses. The result was Stoicheia, a 65-minute work for two percussion soloists, two percussion ensembles, four synthesizers and electronics. The two soloists were Steven Schick and Wood himself, and the work was subsequently recorded by Wergo.</p><h2>Who is James Wood Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>James Wood</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

At the same time he completed several new works for percussion, including a 35-minute work for percussion ensemble, Cloud-Polyphonies, commissioned by a consortium of American Universities headed by Michael Rosen.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>James Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Composer</strong>.
