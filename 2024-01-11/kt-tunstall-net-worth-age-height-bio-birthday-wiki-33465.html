Who is KT Tunstall dating now & how much money does KT Tunstall have?</p><h2>KT Tunstall Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>KT Tunstall</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pop Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>June 23, 1975</strong> in Edinburgh, <strong>Scotland</strong>. Singer-songwriter and guitarist who released the international hit “Suddenly I See.” Her debut single was “Black Horse and the Cherry Tree,” which she performed on <a href=#>Jools Holland</a>‘s show.</p><p>She was nominated in 2007 for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal, but <a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a> won instead.</p><p>Tunstall was born to a half-Chinese, half-Scottish mother, Carol Ann, who was from Hong Kong, and an Irish father. Her parents met while her mother was working as a dancer in Penthouse bar in Edinburgh, where her father was a bartender. She never met her biological father. She was born at Edinburgh’s Western General Hospital, but at 18 days old her mother placed her for adoption to a family in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Her adoptive father, David Tunstall, was employed as a physics lecturer at the University of St Andrews, and her adoptive mother, Rosemary Tunstall, was a primary school teacher. Tunstall’s adoptive family also includes an older brother named Joe and a younger brother named Daniel. The family had no interest in music and owned no records; the only tape her father owned was a comedy recording by mathematician and musical satirist Tom Lehrer. This was largely because Daniel is deaf and they want to avoid anything that could interfere with his hearing aid. She has said: “My earliest memories are Californian”, attributed to a sabbatical that her father took at UCLA in 1979. In spite of living in an academic family, she was musically oriented. Her adoptive parents supported her, and she recollected that she asked for a piano when she was four.</p><p>Tunstall tracked down her biological mother, Carol Ann, in 1996 and learned that her mother was married to cab driver David Orr. She has been critical of the British National Party. In 2010, she publicly disowned Orr because of his decision to run as a BNP candidate in the general election for Livingston. In 2019, she appeared in Series 9 of Long Lost Family. She learned that her biological father had previously died, but she was united with two half-sisters by her biological father’s second marriage.</p><p align=justify>She married <a href=#>Luke Bullen</a> on September 6, 2008. The couple divorced in 2013.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>KT Tunstall</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>KT</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tunstall</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Edinburgh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scotland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>GOD In Christ</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Luke Bullen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>KT Tunstall ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
