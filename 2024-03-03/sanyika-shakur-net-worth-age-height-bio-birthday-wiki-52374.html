Who is Sanyika Shakur dating now & how much money does Sanyika Shakur have?</p><h2>Sanyika Shakur Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Sanyika Shakur</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Writer</strong> who was born on <strong>November 13, 1963</strong> in Los Angeles, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Shakur was born Kody Dejohn Scott in Los Angeles, California, on the 13th of November 1963. She was the daughter of Ernest Scott and Birdie Canada Both were originally from Houston, Texas.&nbsp;Kody was the fifth of six children, including four brothers and two sisters (Kevin,Kim,Kerwin,Kershaun,Kody,and Kendis).&nbsp;Shakur believed that Kody was the child of the former Los Angeles Rams running back Dick Bassand that he was born during an affair his mother was involved with the football player the claim of which there isn’t any convincing evidence.&nbsp;Ernest Scott held a bitter animosity towards Birdie’s marriage and physically assaulted his wife frequently throughout the early years of Shakur’s childhood.&nbsp;Ray Charles is his godfather.</p><p>In 1975, one of the West Side Crips nicknamed Sidewinder created a group known as the Gangster Crips of Eight Trays (also called 83GC, ETG or ETGC) in Shakur’s neighbourhood.&nbsp;On June 15, 1975, which was the day of his graduation from sixth grade, Kody was initiated into the ETGs.&nbsp;Shakur was invited to join the group (also called jumping into the gang: when the gang members assaulted the new recruit to determine whether or not he is courageous enough to stand up and defend themselves or her).</p><p>Shakur’s first arrest occurred in 1978 at age 14 after he shot at the employee of a fast-food restaurant who had assaulted his younger brother Kershaun and later assaulted and pulled a gun on Shakur. Kershawn Scott later joined the Eight Trays and assumed the nickname Li’l Monster.</p><p>On August 9, 1979, Raymond Washington, the founder of the Crips, was murdered in a drive-by shooting near his home. Because Raymond Washington always made it a point never to walk up to cars, it was determined that his killers were people he knew personally since he had walked up to the murderers’ car and had a conversation with them prior to being shot. Washington’s murder was blamed on the Hoover Crips (now known as the Hoover Criminals or Hoover Gang), which started a war between the East Side Crips and the Hoovers.</p><p align=justify>The year was 1972 and Birdie Scott and her husband moved to a home on West 69th Street and Denker Avenue in a rough and gang-ridden neighborhood in the west part of South Central Los Angeles.&nbsp;According Shakur Shakur the first time he came in contact with street gangs was around the age of 10, when he was attacked by two teenagers who stole his money.&nbsp;Because Birdie Scott was employed at a variety of jobs to help support her family, as and the lack of respect was shown to him by Ernest Scott, young Shakur was often seen in street corners of the neighborhood he was moving to.&nbsp;At this point, that he started hanging out with the neighbor, Stanley Tookie Williams, the head in his gang, the West Side Crips street group.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sanyika Shakur</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sanyika</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shakur</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Writer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tamu Naima Shakur</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Keonda Scott, Sanyika Shakur Jr</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sanyika Shakur ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On December 31, 1980, 16-year-old Shakur was ambushed and shot six times by three adult members of the Rollin’ 60s after being set up by a group of girls who were dating friends from his set. Perhaps what saved his life was the fact that earlier that evening Kody had been drinking a cheap brand of low-end fortified wine called Night Train and smoked PCP with other members of the ETGs as the gang celebrated New Year’s Eve, and the level of inebriation that shakur was under at the time of the shooting prevented him from going into shock. After being shot, Shakur reported having hallucinations of seeing the faces of all of the gang members he had shot since joining the Crips, as well as seeing the infant daughter that he had with his girlfriend Tamu. Shakur survived the shooting and was hospitalized for several weeks.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Sanyika Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Writer</strong>.
