After inconsistent placings at numerous major events, the roster split up after a series of poor tournament placings, with Scump performing badly individually.

However, after a 9th-place finish at the MLG Fall Championship and a 13th-place finish at UMG Philadelphia, Scump announced he would be leaving OpTic and joining Team EnVyUs alongside Merk, ProoFy, and Goonjar because of a rivalry with Nadeshot. Less than two-weeks after his departure from OpTic, Scump announced that he was leaving Envy and returning to Optic. He would rejoin the lineup of Nadeshot, MBoZe, and Clayster for the Call of Duty Championship 2014. The squad finished 3rd for the second year in a row.

At the 2015 Call of Duty World Championship, the team placed a disappointing 7th after they went into the event as the clear favorites. After the event, Scumps’s longtime teammate, Nadeshot, decided to leave competitive Call of Duty and was replaced by Damon “Karma” Barlow, with Scump becoming the team captain.

Once again, they fell short and placed 2nd to Scump’s ex-teammate, Clayster’s FaZe team for the final time in AW. Scump then went on to win the final event of Advanced Warfare, MLG World Finals, with OpTic Gaming. He stated that the World Finals was the only event where he felt like he got carried, but it still marked Scump’s and OpTic’s most successful year by far. They won 9 championships, all 3 of the online Pro League Season, appeared in 10/11 Grand Finals, they won many online tournaments hosted by MLG and UMG, earned 1,651,320 pro points, and Seth had the most pro points out of any player with 447,975.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Scump height</b> Not available right now.
