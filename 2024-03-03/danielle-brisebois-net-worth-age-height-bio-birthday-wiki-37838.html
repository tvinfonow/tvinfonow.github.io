Despite a disappointing commercial performance in the U.S, the album became a minor hit in Europe. Arrive All Over You performed well critically and continues to maintain a cult following. Mackenzie Wilson of Allmusic described the album as “an earnest and impressive effort … [that] went largely unnoticed during the reign of gangsta rap and grunge,” and compared it favorably to Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill.
