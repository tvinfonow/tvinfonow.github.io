Who is Stephen Moore dating now & how much money does Stephen Moore have?</p><h2>Stephen Moore Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Stephen Moore</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Economist</strong> who was born on <strong>February 16, 1960</strong> in Chicago, Chicago, <strong>United States</strong>. Stephen Moore (born February 16, 1960) is an American writer and television commentator on economic issues. He co-founded and served as president of the Club for Growth from 1999 to 2004. Moore is a former member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board. He worked at the Heritage Foundation during the period from 1983 to 1987 and again since 2014. Moore advised Herman Cain’s 2012 presidential campaign and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p>In 1999, Moore co-founded the Club for Growth, a group advocating tax cuts and a reduction in government spending, becoming its president. While president of the group, Moore targeted “Republicans in Name Only” whom he viewed as not aligned with his anti-tax views; he criticized Republican Senators who did not readily embrace tax cuts, including Arlen Specter, Olympia Snowe, and George Voinovich.</p><p>In December 2004, the Club for Growth’s board voted to remove Moore as president, with his opponents within the organization upset by his criticism of President George Bush and by the narrow defeat of Senator Pat Toomey, who had the group’s support. After Moore’s departure, lawyers for the group sent letters to him and members of his new organization, the Free Enterprise Fund, threatening legal action for allegedly stealing the group’s mailing list to raise funds for his new organization; Moore’s partner Mallory Factor stated the list was acquired elsewhere.</p><p>On September 19, 2005, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) filed suit against the Club For Growth, alleging that the group had failed to register as a political action committee in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 election cycles “despite spending millions of dollars on federal campaign activity during the 2000, 2002, and 2004 election cycle.” In 2007, the FEC and the Club for Growth agreed to settle the lawsuit, paying $350,000.</p><p align=justify>From 1983 to 1987, Moore served as the Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Budgetary Affairs at the Heritage Foundation. In 1987, Moore was the research director of President Ronald Reagan’s Privatization Commission. Moore spent ten years as a fellow of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. As senior economist of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee under Chairman Dick Armey of Texas, Moore was said to be “instrumental in creating the FairTax proposal”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen Moore</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Economist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anne Carey , Allison Moore</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stephen Moore ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Stephen Moore</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Moore grew up in New Trier Township, Illinois. He attended Saints Faith Hope & Charity School in Winnetka and graduated from New Trier High School in 1978. He received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and a Master of Arts (M.A.) in economics from George Mason University.</p><p align=justify>The nomination stirred immediate criticism by economists, and was widely viewed as the most political appointment to the Federal Reserve Board since the 1980s. Benn Steil, director of international economics for the Council on Foreign Relations, stated he found the decision appalling. Monetary economist George Selgin stated he believed Moore was unfit to serve on the Board. Economist Justin Wolfers called the selection of Moore “the first genuinely bad Trump pick for the Fed” and called on the Senate not to confirm Moore. Harvard economics professor Greg Mankiw said that Moore “does not have the intellectual gravitas” for the position.</p><p align=justify>At the Club for Growth, Moore sought to change the Republican party and in a 2003 interview said, “We want to take over the party’s fund-raising. We want it to be, in 10 years, that no one can win a Senate or a House seat without the support of the Club for Growth.” From 2003 to 2004, the Club for Growth was the single largest fundraiser for Republican House and Senate candidates, only being outdone by the Republican party itself.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Economist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2009, Moore described climate change as “the biggest scam of the last two decades.” In columns and op-eds, Moore called those with concerns about climate change “Stalinistic” and has accused climate scientists as being part of a global conspiracy to obtain money via research grants, asserting that a “tidal wave of funding” revealed “a powerful financial motive for scientists to conclude that the apocalypse is upon us.” In an April 2019 interview, Moore said that the Federal Reserve should not consider the economic impacts of climate change in decision making.</p><p>Moore was married to Allison Moore until 2011. In 2012, a Virginia court held Moore in contempt of court for failing to pay his ex-wife $300,000 in spousal support, child support and other obligations in his divorce settlement. Moore did not respond to repeated court requests to make payments and failed to appear for a deposition before the court threatened to have him arrested and ordered him to sell his home to make the payments; the court revoked the order at Moore’s request after he made a $217,000 payment. In January 2018, the IRS obtained a tax lien against Moore for $75,328 in unpaid federal taxes, interest and penalties, alleging Moore had filed a “fraudulent” tax return in 2014. Moore contended that his accountant made an error in improperly deducting child support payments and that the lien was the result of an IRS miscalculation, though Moore claims to have paid the lien and Montgomery County, Maryland Circuit Court records show the case is closed. In addition to the child support payments, the IRS also disallowed other deductions Moore had claimed.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Stephen Moore height</b> Not available right now.

In 2005, Moore left the Free Enterprise Fund to serve on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.</p><p align=justify>In a 2014 op-ed in the Washington Times, Moore cited the role of a “culture of virtue” in America’s economic success, writing, “What is irrefutable is that marriage with a devoted husband and wife in the home is a far better social program than food stamps, Medicaid, public housing or even all of them combined.”</p><h2>Who is Stephen Moore Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Stephen Moore</strong> married to <strong>Anne Carey , Allison Moore </strong>.
