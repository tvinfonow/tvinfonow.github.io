For his performance, USA Today named him a member of its All-USA High School Baseball Team, and Baseball America named him the top infielder in Northern California, as well as a second-team All-American.

Moreover, he led the National League in triples and stolen bases, becoming the first rookie to do so since 1951, as well as leading the NL in at bats. He was a member of the NL all-star team in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the Phillies only representative.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Jimmy Rollins celebrates birthday on November 27 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Entering the 2002 season, despite his youth, Rollins sought to be a leader in the Phillies’ clubhouse; an article in The Philadelphia Inquirer said, “Rollins, even at just 23 years old, may now have the clout needed to be a stern voice that makes a difference in the clubhouse and on the field.” Rollins’ season was characterized by a strong first half, and a “sophomore jinx” at the plate that plagued him in the second half of the season. For his performance in the early months of the season, he earned his second consecutive selection to the MLB All-Star game, in doing so becoming the first Phillie and first MLB shortstop ever to reach the game in each of his first two seasons. After the all-star game, however, he struggled at the plate, striking out frequently and chasing many high pitches that were out of the strike zone. Ultimately, Rollins finished the season among the NL leaders in defensive statistics – he compiled a .980 fielding percentage (second in NL), 695 total chances (third in NL), 504 assists (fourth in NL), and 226 putouts (fifth in NL). Meanwhile, offensively, he regressed from his 2001 campaign, batting .245/.306/.380 with 11 home runs, but still leading the NL with 10 triples; he stole 31 bases, 15 fewer than he did in 2001. After the season, he participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.</p><h3>Where is Jimmy Rollins now?</h3><p>Jimmy Rollins is the Newest Addition to the <b>Philadelphia Phillies</b> Front Office for 2022 MLB Season, Assisting Dave Dombrowski – Sports Illustrated Inside The Phillies.</p><h3>Is Jimmy Rollins a Hall of Famer?</h3><p><b>First-year Hall of Fame candidate Jimmy Rollins received a total of 37 votes on the 2022 Baseball Writers Association of America Hall of Fame ballot</b>.
