Ingram was the first running back drafted in 2011; since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, this was the latest pick used for the first running back chosen in an NFL draft. The Saints acquired the pick from the New England Patriots, trading their second-round selection (#56 overall) and their first-round selection in 2012 to do so. As Alabama head coach Nick Saban is part of Patriots head coach Bill Belichick’s coaching tree, the Patriots were widely assumed to be interested in drafting Ingram themselves. On July 28, 2011, Ingram decided on the number #28 in honor of his and his father’s draft pick number. The next day Ingram agreed with the Saints on a four-year contract, with three years guaranteed and a fifth year option. The contract is worth $7.41 million, with a $3.89 million signing bonus.</p>You may read full biography about Mark Ingram Jr. from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfoq6zt4yipaCqkaJ6q76Mn6aorJKWua15z6WYsp2iZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2024-03-03%2fmark-ingram-jr-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52325.html&text=Mark%20Ingram%20Jr.%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-03-03%2fmark-ingram-jr-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52325.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-03-03%2fmark-ingram-jr-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52325.html&title=Mark%20Ingram%20Jr.%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2024-03-03%2fmark-ingram-jr-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52325.html&title=Mark%20Ingram%20Jr.%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2024-03-03%2fmark-ingram-jr-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52325.html&title=Mark%20Ingram%20Jr.%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-03-03%2fmark-ingram-jr-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52325.html&description=Mark%20Ingram%20Jr.%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/2024-03-03/mark-j-polish-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-52332.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark J.
