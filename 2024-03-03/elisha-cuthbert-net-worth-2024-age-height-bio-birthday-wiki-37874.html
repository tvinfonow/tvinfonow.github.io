She played an ex–porn star, Danielle, opposite Emile Hirsch. She had reservations about the part, but was persuaded by director Luke Greenfield. She researched the role, speaking to adult actresses from Wicked Pictures and Vivid Entertainment. The film was compared to Risky Business, although Cuthbert said her character was not directly based on Rebecca De Mornay’s. Critics were divided; some praised the film for boldness, others, notably Roger Ebert, called it gimmicky and exploitative. Ebert wrote that he saw Cuthbert’s character as “quite the most unpleasant character I have seen in some time.” The View London said: “Cuthbert is surprisingly good, too – aside from being drop dead gorgeous, she also proves herself a capable comic actress in the Cameron Diaz mould”. Cuthbert won two nominations for the MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss and Best Breakthrough Performance.</p><p>Cuthbert has two younger siblings and enjoys painting, is an ice hockey fan and Los Angeles Kings season-ticket holder.

Her first major lead role came in the 1998 drama film Airspeed (No Control) alongside Joe Mantegna. In 2001, she starred in the movie Lucky Girl, in which she received her first award, the Gemini Awards, but her career began in earnest in the 2000s when she played Kim Bauer, daughter of Jack Bauer in the action series 24.

In one scene, her character attempted to open her mouth while her lips were sealed with glue. For realism, she used Superglue over prosthetics. House of Wax was largely panned, critics citing a range of flaws. It was called “notable for having some of the most moronic protagonists ever to populate a horror film,” though of those characters, critics tended to think Cuthbert “fares the best.” Though it received negative reviews the film was a box office success, which grossed $70&nbsp;million worldwide. The Houston Chronicle cited Cuthbert as an exception. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said of the film, “Elisha Cuthbert’s matter-of-fact, likable quality helps. Seeing her turn into wax would be as bad as seeing that happen to Glenda Farrell (the star of the 1933 version).” The Movie said: “The performances are always professional and understated in their believable cogency, particularly Cuthbert, a talented, beautiful young actress who has proven time and again just what a multilayered and promising future she has ahead of her. Cuthbert digs into the role of Carly with strength, determination, and horrified realism; you believe as you watch her that she is going through these things and forget all about the actor playing the part, which is the biggest compliment of all. Sergio Leone of Filmjerk.com said: “[Paris] Hilton … only plays her known personality in the film. She’s overshadowed by the strong work from the rest of the cast, notably Chad Michael Murray and especially Elisha Cuthbert, who gives the film a strong dose of enthusiasm with her Jamie Lee Curtis esque performance.” Cuthbert was nominated at Teen Choice Awards in two categories Choice Movie: Actress – Action / Adventure / Thriller and Choice Movie: Rumble.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Elisha Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Actress</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Canada</strong>. Elisha Cuthbert celebrates birthday on November 30 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Cuthbert’s next film was the indie film The Quiet. She was co-star and co-producer. She played Nina, a temperamental 17-year-old cheerleader who suffers sexual abuse by her father. Cuthbert looked to her younger cousin as inspiration for how to play a teenager. The Quiet, distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and received a limited release in Los Angeles and New York City on August 25, 2006, before expanding regionally in the US on September 1. Cuthbert initially wanted to play role of the silent Dot, but director Jamie Babbit instead cast Camilla Belle in that part after Thora Birch pulled out. Babbit reasoned that “To me, Dot has to be someone you could believe would be invisible in high school. You look at Elisha, this beautiful woman with the most perfect body you’ve ever seen, and you think, there’s no high school in America where this girl could be invisible. No matter how much hair and makeup I do, it’s not going to happen.” The Daily Californian conceded that “Despite the plot’s failings, Cuthbert does a convincing job in her role, exuding an outer shell so tough that when her inner, softer layers emerge, it’s a natural change of character. Empire Movies agreed, commenting that “this is Elisha Cuthbert’s best film performance to date. Cuthbert’s Nina has the majority of the most graphic and disturbing dialogue in the film, especially during one particular lunchroom scene where the camera is close up on Cuthbert and Belle’s faces.”</p><h3>Is Elisha Cuthbert still married?</h3><table readability=1><tr>Elisha Cuthbert</tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Actress model</td></tr><tr><td>Years active</td><td>1996–present</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse(s)</td><td>Dion Phaneuf ​ ( m. 2013)​</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>2</td></tr></table><h3>Is Elisha Cuthbert in Yellowstone?</h3><p>Alongside the pair, the series also featured Sam Elliott as their father Beau and <b>Elisha Cuthbert as Colt’s love interest Abby</b>.
