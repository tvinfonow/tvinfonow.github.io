He additionally received attention for stat padding in a home game against the Utah Jazz on March 16, 2003. With Cleveland leading 120–95 and less than a minute remaining, Davis was one rebound short of his first career triple double, and he deliberately tossed an inbound pass off his own rim and caught it in attempt to receive credit for a rebound, but shots taken at one’s own basket do not count as official field goal attempts. Jazz guard DeShawn Stevenson shoved Davis in response as Davis proceeded upcourt with the ball. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said to reporters afterward, “I would have fouled him too. I would have knocked him on his ass.” The Cavaliers initially said they would not punish Davis, saying the embarrassment was enough. However, in the face of a national outcry, the Cavaliers fined him an undisclosed amount for unsportsmanlike conduct, and the play led to Davis being nicknamed “Wrong Rim Ricky” in Cleveland.</p><h2>Ricky Davis Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ricky Davis is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States.
