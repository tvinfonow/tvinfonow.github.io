He was the founder of the hedge fund Scion Capital, which he ran from 2000 until 2008, before closing the firm to focus on his own personal investments. Burry was the first investor to recognize and profit from the impending subprime mortgage crisis.</p><p>Burry then left to start his own hedge fund. He had already developed a reputation as an investor by demonstrating success in value investing, which he wrote about on message boards on the stock discussion site Silicon Investor beginning in 1996. He was so successful with his stock picks that he attracted the interest of companies such as Vanguard, White Mountains Insurance Group and prominent investors such as Joel Greenblatt. Burry has a strictly traditional understanding of value. He has said more than once that his investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book Security Analysis: “All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael Burry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maloney</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Physician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1971</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Jose</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Michael Burry ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The company was named after Terry Brooks’ The Scions of Shannara (1990), one of his favorite novels. Burry quickly earned extraordinary profits for his investors. According to the author Michael Lewis, “in his first full year, 2001, the S&P 500 fell 11.88 percent. Scion was up 55 percent. Burry was able to achieve these returns by shorting overvalued tech stocks at the peak of the internet bubble. The next year, the S&P 500 fell again, by 22.1 percent, and yet Scion was up again: 16 percent. The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69 percent, but Mike Burry beat it again—his investments rose by 50 percent. By the end of 2004, Mike Burry was managing $600 million and turning money away.”</p><h2>Michael Burry Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michael Burry is one of the <strong>richest Physician</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Michael Burry</b>'s net worth <strong>$200–300 million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Michael Burry was born in 1971 and grew up in San Jose, California. At the age of two he lost one of his eyes to cancer and has had an artificial eye ever since.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$200–300 million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Physician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2005, Burry started to focus on the subprime market. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly predicted that the real estate bubble would collapse as early as 2007. Burry’s research on the values of residential real estate convinced him that subprime mortgages, especially those with “teaser” rates, and the bonds based on these mortgages, would begin losing value when the original rates were replaced by much higher rates, often in as little as two years after initiation. This conclusion led Burry to short the market by persuading Goldman Sachs and other investment firms to sell him credit default swaps against subprime deals he saw as vulnerable. This analysis proved correct, and Burry profited accordingly. Burry has since said, “I don’t go out looking for good shorts. I’m spending my time looking for good longs. I shorted mortgages because I had to. Every bit of logic I had led me to this trade and I had to do it.”</p><p>According to his website, Burry liquidated his credit default swap short positions by April 2008 and did not benefit from the bailouts of 2008 and 2009. He subsequently liquidated his company to focus on his personal investment portfolio.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Burry height</b> Not available right now.

Eventually, Burry’s analysis proved correct; he earned a personal profit of $100 million and a profit for his remaining investors of more than $700 million. Scion Capital ultimately recorded returns of 489.34% (net of fees and expenses) between its November 1, 2000 inception and June 2008.
