Took over as the head coach of Notre Dame’s football team in 2010 and led the Fighting Irish to the BCS title game in 2012. Before his time at Notre Dame, he coached at Grand Valley State, Central Michigan, and Cincinnati.</p><p>He coached linebacker <a href=#>Manti Teo</a> at Notre Dame.</p><p>Kelly was born in Everett, Massachusetts, and was raised in a Catholic Irish-American family in Chelsea, Massachusetts. He attended St. John’s Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts. His father was a Boston politician. He was a four-year letter winner at Assumption College as a linebacker. After graduating from Assumption in 1983 with a bachelor’s degree in political science he served as linebackers coach, defensive coordinator, and softball coach from 1983 to 1986.</p><p>Kelly joined the Grand Valley State University staff in 1987 as a graduate assistant and defensive backs coach for Tom Beck and became the defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator in 1989.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Brian Kelly</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He played linebacker at Assumption college from 1979 to 1982.</p><p align=justify>He won five Coach of the Year awards in 2012, including the AP College Football Coach of the Year.</p><p align=justify>Brian Keith Kelly (born October 25, 1961) is an American football coach and former player. He is currently the head football coach at the University of Notre Dame, a position he has held since December 2009. Kelly was previously head coach at Grand Valley State University (1991–2003), Central Michigan University (2004–2006), and the University of Cincinnati (2006–2009). He led the Grand Valley State Lakers to consecutive NCAA Division II Football Championships in 2002 and 2003. Kelly’s 2012 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team reached the 2013 BCS National Championship Game.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Celebrity</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Kelly became the 24th head coach at Central Michigan University after the departure of Mike DeBord following the 2003 season. Kelly inherited a team with limited success. Central Michigan had won more than three games only once in the previous four seasons. CMU finished with a 4–7 record in 2004. In Kelly’s second year at Central Michigan, he coached the team to a 6–5 record—the first winning season in seven years for the Chippewas. In his third season, the Chippewas posted a 9–4 record under Kelly en route to winning the MAC Championship and qualifying for the Motor City Bowl. At the end of the 2006 season, Kelly left to accept the Cincinnati coaching vacancy three days after CMU won the 2006 MAC Championship. Jeff Quinn was named the interim for Central Michigan’s contest in the Motor City Bowl against Middle Tennessee. Kelly’s record at Central Michigan in three seasons was 19–16.</p><p>Kelly was named Cincinnati’s head coach on December 3, 2006, following the departure of Mark Dantonio. In an unusual move, Cincinnati elected not to appoint an interim coach and asked Kelly to assume his duties immediately by coaching the Bearcats in their bowl game. Central Michigan was also preparing for a bowl appearance, so while Kelly was in Cincinnati preparing the Bearcats, much of his staff remained at Central Michigan to coach the Chippewas. Following Central Michigan’s 31–14 win in the Motor City Bowl on December 26, most of his staff joined him in Cincinnati, where they went on to coach Cincinnati to a 27–24 victory over Western Michigan University in that year’s International Bowl on January 6. Cincinnati’s victory gave Kelly the unique distinction of having defeated the same team twice in a season as coach of two different teams (Central Michigan had defeated Western Michigan 31–7 earlier that season).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Brian Kelly height</b> <strong>5 feet 9 inches</strong> Brian <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 9 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In his 13 years as head coach at Grand Valley State, the Lakers won five conference titles and made six Division II Playoff appearances.
