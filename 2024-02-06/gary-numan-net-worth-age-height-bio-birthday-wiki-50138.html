Who is Gary Numan dating now & how much money does Gary Numan have?</p><h2>Gary Numan Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Gary Numan</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Pop Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>March 8, 1958</strong> in London, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. English musician, composer and musician who created electronic music for commercial use such as the hit songs “Cars” and “Are ‘Friends’ Electric?”</p><p>He was a major influence on other artists like&nbsp;Dave Grohl, Trent Reznor, and Marilyn Manson with his music.</p><p>Gary Anthony James Webb (born 8 March 1958), better known as Gary Numan, is an English singer, musician, songwriter, composer, and record producer. He entered the music industry as the frontman of the new wave band Tubeway Army. After releasing two albums with the band, he released his debut solo album The Pleasure Principle in 1979, topping the UK Albums Chart. While his commercial popularity peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the No. 1 singles “Are ‘Friends’ Electric?” and “Cars”, he maintains a strong cult following.</p><p>In the late 1970s, Numan began developing his style. According to Numan, this was an unintentional result of acne; before an appearance on Top of the Pops, “I had spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white make-up on me before I’d even walked in the door. And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show.” His “wooden” stage presence was, in his words, a result of extreme self-consciousness and lack of “showmanship” and often referred to as being “like an android”. During this period, Numan generated an army of fans calling themselves “Numanoids”, providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through the latter half of the 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall. He later said that he “got really hung up with this whole thing of not feeling, being cold about everything, not letting emotions get to you, or presenting a front of not feeling”.</p><p align=justify>He got married Gemma O’Neil, a longtime fan of his. The couple, along with their three children live within East Sussex.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gary Numan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gary</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Numan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Gemma O'Neil</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Gary Numan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Gary Numan's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Gary Numan's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>With his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as Dramatis, Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit “Love Needs No Disguise” from the album For Future Reference and lent vocals to the first single release by his long-term bassist Paul Gardiner, “Stormtrooper in Drag”, which also made the charts. However, Numan’s career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as Adam Ant, and later by the Human League, Duran Duran, and Depeche Mode. Each album also saw a new “image”, none of which captured the public’s imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979.</p><h2>Gary Numan Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Gary Numan is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Gary Numan</b>'s net worth <strong>$7 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was an operator of a lift truck as well as an air conditioning vent fitter and a clerk in the accounting department while a teen and also joined in the Air Training Corps.</p><p align=justify>He was the founder of Tubeway Army, a British punk rock group Tubeway Army with his uncle, Jess Lidyard, and Paul Gardiner.</p><p align=justify>Numan was born Gary Anthony James Webb on 8 March 1958 in Hammersmith, London. His father was a British Airways bus driver based at Heathrow Airport. He was educated at Town Farm Junior School in Stanwell, Surrey; Ashford County Grammar School; and Slough Grammar School, followed by Brooklands Technical College in Weybridge, Surrey. He joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager and then briefly held various jobs including forklift truck driver, air conditioning ventilator fitter, and accounts clerk. When Numan was 15 years old, his father bought him a Gibson Les Paul, which became his most treasured possession. He played in various bands, including Mean Street and the Lasers, before forming Tubeway Army with his uncle, Jess Lidyard, and Paul Gardiner. His initial pseudonym was “Valerian”, probably in reference to the hero in French science fiction comic series Valérian and Laureline. He later picked the surname “Numan” from an advert in the Yellow pages for a plumber whose surname was “Neumann”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A few months later Numan found success in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with “Cars”, which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in 1979, No.&nbsp;1 in Canada and No.&nbsp;9 in the U.S. in 1980. “Cars” and the 1979 album The Pleasure Principle were both released under Numan’s own stage name. The album reached number-one in the UK, and a sell-out tour (The Touring Principle) followed; the concert video it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial music video release. The Pleasure Principle was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesisers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, “Complex”, made it to No.&nbsp;6 on the UK Singles Chart.</p><p>A self-titled, new wave-oriented debut album later that same year sold out its limited run and introduced Numan’s fascination with dystopian science fiction and synthesisers. Tubeway Army’s third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced “Down in the Park” (1979), and though it never appeared on the charts, it became one of Numan’s most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the 1980 film Times Square, and a live version of the song can be seen in the 1982 film Urgh! A Music War. Following exposure in a television advertisement for Lee Cooper jeans with the jingle “Don’t Be a Dummy”, Tubeway Army released the single “Are ‘Friends’ Electric?” in May 1979. After seven weeks the single climbed to No.&nbsp;1 at the end of June; its parent album Replicas simultaneously reached No.&nbsp;1.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Gary Numan height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Gary <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Numan came to prominence at the mid of the 1970s as lead singer, songwriter, and record producer for Tubeway Army. After recording an album’s worth of punk-influenced demo tapes (released in 1984 as The Plan), he was signed by Beggars Banquet Records in 1978 and quickly released two singles, “That’s Too Bad” and “Bombers”, neither of which charted.</p><p align=justify>Numan joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager, when he wanted to be either a pilot or a pop star. In 1978 he started learning to fly at Blackbushe, but the success of his music career in 1979 meant that obtaining his Private Pilot’s Licence was delayed until 17 December 1980. The following day; 18 December 1980, Numan bought his first aeroplane for £12,000; a Cessna 182. On 1 July 1981 Numan founded Numanair, a small charter flight company operating from Blackbushe, and acquired a Cessna 210 Centurion (registered G-OILS) and a Piper Navajo (registered G-NMAN). He also indulged his passion for motor racing in 1981 by sponsoring Mike Mackonochie who drove a Van Diemen RF81 in Numanair livery in the Formula Ford 1600 class.</p><h2>Who is Gary Numan Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Gary Numan</strong> married to <strong>Gemma O'Neil </strong>.

Gary Numan celebrates birthday on March 8 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 1980, Numan topped the album charts for a third time with Telekon, with the singles “We Are Glass”, “I Die: You Die” released prior to the album reaching No.&nbsp;5 and No.&nbsp;6. “This Wreckage” taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20. Telekon, the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the “Machine” section of his career, reintroduced guitars to Numan’s music and featured a wider range of synthesisers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour (“The Teletour”) with an even more elaborate stage show than the Touring Principle the previous year. He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at Wembley Arena in April 1981, supported by experimental musician Nash the Slash and Shock, a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included Barbie Wilde, Tik and Tok, and Carole Caplin. A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No.&nbsp;2 in the charts. Both albums, also individually released as Living Ornaments ’79 and Living Ornaments ’80 also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.</p><h3>Why did Gary Numan retire?</h3><p>Numan retired from touring in 1981, claiming that <b>he didn’t enjoy the experience as much as he thought he would</b>, performing three final “farewell” sold-out concerts at Wembley Arena in April 1981. 16.</p><h3>Is Gary Numan rich?</h3><p>Gary Numan net worth: Gary Numan is an English singer, composer, and musician who has a net worth of <b>$7 million dollars</b>.</p><h3>How long has Gary Numan been married?</h3><p><b>Gary Numan married Gemma O’Neill in 1997</b>.
