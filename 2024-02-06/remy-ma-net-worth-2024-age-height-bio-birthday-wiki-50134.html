She now plans to go it alone.</p><p>Reminisce Mackie (née Smith; May 30, 1980), known professionally as Remy Ma, is an American rapper. She was initially discovered by Big Pun, and came to prominence for her work as a member of Fat Joe’s group, Terror Squad. On February 7, 2006, she released her debut studio album There’s Something About Remy: Based on a True Story, which was a modest success, peaking at number 33 on the Billboard 200 chart. She is one of only six female rappers to ever top the Billboard Hot 100 chart (as a member of Terror Squad on “Lean Back”), and one of only four multiple winners of the BET Award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist, which she won in 2005 and 2017.</p><p>A beef between Remy Ma and Foxy Brown originated in August 2004, when an interviewer noted to Remy: “Right now, it’s a lack of female rappers in the game. Foxy don’t got anything going on,” Remy Ma responded: “How do I feel about them? Stay wherever they at, don’t drop a song, don’t do nothing, let me be the only one. I’m having so much fun. I hope they never come out. Nah, I wish everyone the best of luck. Just don’t drop when I drop. That’s all I got to say. Matter of fact, just don’t drop at all. It’ll even be better.” In September 2004, Remy recalled that after a rap battle with Lady Luck at Fight Klub, her refusal to “show some type of seniority or respect” to Brown became one of the building blocks in the feud. Remy also recalled that during the incident the two were arguing over a future rap battle, where Brown declined and allegedly stated, “What? A battle? That’s for beginners. We sell records in Brooklyn!” Remy dissed the rapper, responding, “When the last time you sold a record? Get the fuck out of here. I’d rather be a beginner that’s on fire than be a washed-up veteran. Are you fucking serious? Don’t try to degrade what I do.” Remy additionally revealed that a prize of over $200,000 was offered to whoever won the rap battle.</p><p align=justify>She was forced to be a surrogate mom to her younger siblings because of family drug abuse.&nbsp;She is the mother of&nbsp;Due to family drug abuse, she had to act as a surrogate mother to her younger siblings.

That’s wack. We sell records [in New York]. We don’t just get on the radio station and pop shit.” In February 2006, Remy Ma released a freestyle record (“Most Anticipated”) that contained “slick comments” about Brown’s hearing problem and stated that she didn’t care if it was offensive because “it was just good punchlines”.

Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Ma, however, Ma remarked in a 2010 interview: “To this day I still feel like (the song) is a stab at me; I’m gonna (diss Minaj) back for that one”.
