In Germany, Nightingale continued her stage musical career in Hair (as Sheila), Jesus Christ Superstar, and Godspell, and she began a relationship with Minoru Terada Domberger, the director of the German production of Hair, which led to marriage and a daughter, Langka Veva Domberger, born in 1973.</p><p>One of the three children of Guyanese-born comedian Benny Nightingale and his wife Iris (they also had daughter Rosalind and son Glen), Maxine Nightingale first vocalized with her school band. At thirteen, she and a friend visited a neighbourhood house where the band Unisound was rehearsing. They asked her to sing with them and she joined them in performing extensively on the British cabaret circuit. The manager of one of the clubs where they performed asked Nightingale to cut a demo and shipped it to Pye Records, for whom Nightingale made her first recordings. Despite being overseen by label A&R head Cyril Stapleton, Nightingale’s three Pye single releases—issued in June and July 1969 and 26 March 1971—went unnoticed.</p><p align=justify>Her father is comedian Benny Nightingale.&nbsp;Langka, her daughter, was born in 1973.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maxine Nightingale</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maxine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nightingale</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soul Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wembley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Benny Nightingale, Iris Burke</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Minoru Terada Domberger</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Maxine Nightingale ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Both were overlooked despite her promotion of the latter in another Top of the Pops appearance on 8 June 1978. The US release of “Lead Me On” early in 1979 met with a favorable reception, especially in the easy listening market, and the track reached #1 on Billboard’s Easy Listening chart that July; the track gradually accrued enough mainstream pop support to reach #5 on the Hot 100 that September. As with “Right Back Where We Started From”, she was unable to follow up her US Top Ten success, the subsequent “(Bringing Out) The Girl in Me” marking her final Hot 100 appearance with a #73 peak. Lead Me On is a re-packaged and slightly remixed version of the previous European LP with the addition of a new song, the disco-styled “Hideaway”. The songs “Lead Me On” and “Hideaway” were extended for a promotional 12-inch record.</p><h2>Maxine Nightingale Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Maxine Nightingale is one of the <strong>richest Soul Singer</strong> from United Kingdom.

She then dropped out of the pop mainstream, working for some 20 years as a more jazz-oriented live performer. She has reportedly recorded an album of her live performance at B.B. King’s Club at Universal Studios Hollywood although it remains unreleased. Since 2000, she has become active on the retro music circuit, appearing in the 2004 PBS music specials Superstars of Seventies Soul: Live and the 2012 My Music: 70s Soul Superstars.</p><p>Nightingale returned to London with her husband and daughter and appeared in the West End production of Savages, after which she withdrew from professional performing. According to Nightingale, “I started doing session singing. I didn’t do a lot but it was easy to go out in the evening when the baby was sleeping.” Her vocalizing on the recording of Al Matthews’ “Fool” caught the attention of the session’s producer Pierre Tubbs, enough that he asked composer J. Vincent Edwards, who had worked with Nightingale in the West End production of Hair, to co-write a song for her, which became “Right Back Where We Started From”. Tubbs asked her to sing on the demo; as she told the story in 2013, “he took it straight to United Artists Records [in London], and they loved it too. They paid me 100 pounds [… and after that,] they [offered] me an advance and a contract to finish recording the single.” After being released on United Artists Records (in Nightingale’s true name), “Right Back Where We Started From” reached #8 in the UK in the autumn of 1975. It was released in the US early 1976 to enthusiastic reaction, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1976. Nightingale, who had accompanied her husband to his native Japan, was motivated by her single’s US success to return to London to complete a Right Back Where We Started From album. She then proceeded to the US, which has since remained her home base.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Maxine Nightingale height</b> Not available right now.
