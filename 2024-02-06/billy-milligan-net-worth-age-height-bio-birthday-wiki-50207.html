Who is Billy Milligan dating now & how much money does Billy Milligan have?</p><h2>Billy Milligan Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Billy Milligan</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Criminal</strong> who was born on <strong>February 14, 1955</strong> in Miami Beach, Florida, <strong>United States</strong>. Dorothy Milligan grew up in Ohio farming country, and was a resident of Lancaster with her former husband.&nbsp;They separated, and Dorothy eventually relocated to the Miami region where she was an artist.&nbsp;In Miami, she was being married to Johnny Morrison.&nbsp;Dorothy Morrison and Morrison had two additional youngsters: A son named Jim Milligan, in October 1953 and a daughter, Kathy Jo Milligan, born in December 1956.</p><p>Dorothy had her children with her and left Miami and eventually returned back to Lancaster, Ohio, where she married her ex-husband.&nbsp;The union lasted just one year.&nbsp;The year was 1962 when she was married to Chalmer Milligan (1927-1988).&nbsp;His first spouse Bernice divorced him due to “grounds of gross neglect”.&nbsp;His daughter named Challa who was the same age as Billy and a second daughter who worked as nursing.&nbsp;Dorothy and Chalmer got married at Circleville, Ohio, on the 27th of October in 1963.</p><p>Daniel Keyes authored a biographical non-fiction novel called The Minds of Billy Milligan (1981, available in fourteen languages). His follow-up book, The Milligan Wars, was published in Japan in 1994, in Taiwan in 2000, in France in 2009, in Ukraine in 2018, but not yet in the United States, first owing to Milligan’s ongoing lawsuit against the State of Ohio for the allegedly inadequate treatment he received in Ohio facilities, then to the desire to tie its release to an in-development film.</p><p>Several attempts had been made by Hollywood to adapt Keyes’ book. In the early 1990s, James Cameron co-wrote a screenplay with Todd Graff for a film version he was to direct then-titled A Crowded Room. This adaptation never came into fruition because Cameron was sued by adaptation rightsholder Sandy Arcara, demanding “her salary should be raised from $250,000 to $1.5 million”; seeing the project stalled, Milligan also sued Cameron in 1993. After Cameron left the project, Warner Bros. continued to develop it now slightly retitled The Crowded Room, with directors Joel Schumacher and David Fincher attached at various points. Actors courted for the role of Milligan included Matthew McConaughey, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Sean Penn and John Cusack. As of August&nbsp;2014, the film remains in limbo. In February 2015, it was confirmed that Leonardo DiCaprio would star as Milligan, with Jason Smilovic set to pen the script.</p><p align=justify>Morrison struggled with the role of father and, According to Daniel Keyes, “Meeting the medical expenses overwhelmed Johnny. He borrowed more, gambled more, drank more […]. [He] was hospitalized for acute alcoholism and depression in […] 1958.”&nbsp;It was believed like a suicide plan as per Keyes, “[Dorothy] found him slumped over the table, half a bottle of Scotch and an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the floor.”&nbsp;After a few months of the suicide attempt, on the 17th of January 1959 Johnny took his own life by poisoning himself with carbon monoxide.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Billy Milligan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Billy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Milligan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Miami Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Johnny Morrison, Dorothy Milligan</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kathy Jo Milligan, Jim Milligan</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Billy Milligan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
