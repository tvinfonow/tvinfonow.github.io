Elaine Marie Welteroth (born December 10, 1986) is an American journalist, editor and New York Times best-selling author. In April 2016, Welteroth was named editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, making her the second person of African-American heritage in Condé Nast’s 107-year history to hold such a title. Her promotion to editor at age 29 makes her the second youngest editor in Condé Nast history, behind current Teen Vogue EIC Lindsay Peoples Wagner who was 28 when she started in the role in Condé Nast. When she became beauty director of Teen Vogue in 2012, Welteroth was the first person of African-American heritage to serve in the role. She is credited for the notable increase of Teen Vogue coverage of politics and social justice, encouraging readers to become civically engaged, specifically during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Under Welteroth’s leadership of Teen Vogue’s shifting format, the magazine developed its first YouTube channel, featuring content on diverse subjects from campus style to cultural appropriation. The final print edition of Teen Vogue was December 2017.</p><p>Via Instagram, Welteroth quickly developed her brand and Teen Vogue’s brand by posting behind the scenes photos and videos of photoshoots, her personal photos, and selfies with celebrities. In 2014, as Teen Vogue’s beauty and health director, she was invited by Target to update a Fashion Week Instagram Diary of her experience being backstage at the New York and London Fashion Weeks. Her social media also broadcasts her own accomplishments and Teen Vogue’s accomplishments, by sharing personal footage from her personal and professional life at least once or twice a day.</p><p>In December 2016, Welteroth became engaged to musician Jonathan Singletary and was married in May, 2020. The wedding took place in their street and followed strict social distancing laws set out as a result of the Coronavirus. The two originally met as children while they attended the same church. She also provided background vocals for Singletary’s song, “Don’t Fight Alone”.</p><p>On December 7, 2016, Teen Vogue made an appearance on the award-winning ABC sitcom Black-ish. In the episode “Nothing, but Nepotism”, Welteroth plays herself as editor of Teen Vogue while Black-ish character Zoe gets the opportunity to intern at Teen Vogue to boost her high school resume by using her advertising executive father’s professional connections. The episode resulted in discussions on nepotism in the black community, such as the article, “On black nepotism and this week’s epic ‘black-ish’ & ‘Teen Vogue’ crossover” by Blavity writer Trey Mangum. During the advance screening of the episode and discussion, Welteroth raised the question, “Is black nepotism just leveling the playing field?”</p><p align=justify>At Slate, Mark Joseph Stern credited Welteroth for developing Teen Vogue into a publication that “treats teenagers like rounded human beings with agency and intellect”. Stern continues with, “The result is a teen glossy with seriously good political coverage and legal analysis, an outlet for teenagers who—shockingly!—are able to think about fashion and current events simultaneously.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elaine Welteroth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elaine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elaine</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1987</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Santa Clara, CA</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Elaine Welteroth ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
