Kim was born in Seoul, South Korea, and at age 5 was adopted in 1973 by Ralph and Marilyn Kerr. He has five children, two from a previous marriage (Michael and Laura) and three with Kim (Jessica, Kelly and Matthew).

Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Terry Pegula's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Terry Pegula's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>An alumnus of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), Pegula donated $102 million for the construction of the on-campus Pegula Ice Arena in 2010. As a result, the Penn State Nittany Lions, which had fielded club teams in both men’s and women’s hockey for years, would be able to transition both teams into NCAA Division I starting in the 2012–13 season.</p><h2>Terry Pegula Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Terry Pegula is one of the <strong>richest Businessman</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Terry Pegula</b>'s net worth <strong>$4.9 billion (January 2020)</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Terrence Michael Pegula (born March 27, 1951) is an American billionaire businessman, with interests in natural gas development, real estate, entertainment and professional sports. He is the owner of Pegula Sports and Entertainment which owns the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) and, with his wife Kim Pegula, the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$4.9 billion (January 2020)</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Businessman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In May 2011, Pegula began negotiations on behalf of the Sabres to re-purchase the Rochester Americans, which had served as the Sabres’ American Hockey League affiliate from 1979 to 2008 (and had been owned by the Sabres from 1979 to 1996); the deal was completed in late June 2011. As part of the deal the Americans had to be split off from its NLL counterpart the Rochester Knighthawks since Pegula owned the Bandits due to ownership rules at the time. Along with the purchase of the Americans came upgrades to the team’s arena, the Blue Cross Arena.</p><p>In February 2011, Pegula purchased Hockey Western New York LLC (the holding company that owns the Buffalo Sabres and the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League) from previous owners Tom Golisano, Larry Quinn, and Dan DiPofi for $189 million. Pegula’s purchase made an immediate positive impact, with players, fans and alumni invigorated by his investment in the team, the then First Niagara Center and the building of HarborCenter across the street. Pegula was quoted as saying, “Starting today, the Buffalo Sabres’ reason for existence, will be to win a Stanley Cup.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Terry Pegula height</b> Not available right now.

Pegula and his wife have made political donations to politicians of both parties, generally to incumbents. In 2010, Pegula and his wife donated $280,000 to Republican Tom Corbett’s campaign during the Pennsylvania governor’s race. They were the largest contributors to the Pennsylvania Attorney General. In New York, Pegula and his wife donated $25,000 to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s campaign during the 2014 elections and also donated $12,000 to Buffalo mayor Byron Brown, $2,500 to senator Chuck Schumer, and $250 to state senator Tim Kennedy, all Democrats. Pegula expressed support for legalizing ridesharing in upstate New York, the only area where it at the time remained illegal (as of 2017, New York State had only legalized it in New York City) and has announced intent to partner with Uber to provide transportation to Pegula’s sporting events.</p><p align=justify>This led to a domino effect across the men’s college hockey landscape. Because six Big Ten universities now had Division I men’s hockey programs (the minimum number of teams required under Big Ten bylaws for official conference sponsorship, and also the minimum required for a conference to be an automatic postseason qualifier), it was announced that Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State would join Penn State in the Big Ten hockey conference starting in the 2013–2014 season. As a result, the CCHA ceased operations, with most schools (save for the three that joined the Big Ten and Notre Dame) joining the WCHA. Miami University and Western Michigan University, also previously in the CCHA, joined the upstart National Collegiate Hockey Conference along with former WCHA members St. Cloud State, Minnesota-Duluth, Denver, Colorado College, Nebraska-Omaha, and North Dakota. Ex-CCHA member Notre Dame joined Hockey East, which then recruited UConn from the Atlantic Hockey Association to begin play in Hockey East in 2014. After the dust settled, the ECAC was the only Division I conference not affected by the major conference realignment. Notre Dame subsequently left Hockey East in 2017 to join the Big Ten for hockey only.</p><h2>Who is Terry Pegula Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Terry Pegula</strong> married to <strong>Kim Pegula </strong>.
