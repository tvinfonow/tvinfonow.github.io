Tourism boomed during Marc Morial’s mayoralty; the city’s downtown core saw the construction of 14 new hotels during his tenure. This development was due in part to the much-publicized reduction in New Orleans’ high crime rate through the effective leadership of Morial’s Superintendent of Police, Richard Pennington. Of particular significance was the 60% reduction achieved in the city’s violent crime rate. These real gains enabled a resurgence of interest and investment in the city’s older historic neighborhoods. New Orleans benefited from an increase in downtown population. The number of households within the city limits stabilized for the first time since beginning their decline in the 1960s, a significant accomplishment. Morial also secured bond issues for street improvements, the Canal Street streetcar line, and an expansion of the city’s convention center.</p><p>After an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1990, in which he came in second place and was defeated in a runoff by Bill Jefferson, Morial was elected to the Louisiana State Senate in 1992, where he served until 1994.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Marc Morial height</b> Not available right now.

In the 1998 Mayoral Election, Morial received 79% of the votes, while his opponents Paul D. Borrello received 1% and Kathleen Cresson received 20%. Like his father, Dutch Morial, Marc Morial made an attempt to amend the city charter to run for a third term as mayor in 2002. It was tied to his campaign to save the New Orleans Public School System by assuming control of the city’s public schools to turn around their performance.

But, 61% of the voters rejected the proposed amendment to the New Orleans City Charter.</p><h2>Who is Marc Morial Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Marc Morial</strong> married to <strong>Michelle Miller </strong>.
