Umberger in March 2011; a $2,500 fine for slew footing Matt Niskanen in December 2011; a five-game ban for a predatory low-bridge hit on Sami Salo in January 2012; two games for slew-footing Derick Brassard in January 2015; and three games for clipping Mark Borowiecki in December 2015. In February 2017, the league docked Marchand $10,000, the maximum allowable amount per the collective bargaining agreement, for a dangerous trip of Detroit Red Wings defenceman Niklas Kronwall. In January 2018, Marchand was again suspended for five games for what was ruled a deliberate elbow to the head of Marcus Johansson. In March 2018, Marchand was fined $2,000 for diving. The following month, Marchand was fined $5,000, the maximum allowable under the collective bargaining agreement, for cross-checking Philadelphia Flyers defenceman Andrew MacDonald, marking the third time Marchand faced supplementary discipline in the 2017–18 NHL season and the sixth time he’s been fined for his behavior in the NHL. Marchand was also involved in two separate but similar incidents in which he would kiss or lick the neck or face of other players during play. The first of these incidents involved Toronto Maple Leafs forward Leo Komarov during the Bruins’ and Maple Leafs’ First Round matchup in the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, while the second incident, this time involving Tampa Bay Lightning forward Ryan Callahan, took place the following round.</p><h2>Brad Marchand Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Brad Marchand is one of the <strong>richest Hockey Player</strong> from Canada.
