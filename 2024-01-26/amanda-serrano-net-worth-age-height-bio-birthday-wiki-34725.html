Boxer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest female boxers of her era, becoming the first woman and first Puerto Rican ever to win world titles in five separate weight divisions. She has won titles as a bantamweight, super bantamweight, featherweight, super featherweight and lightweight.</p><p>She appeared with fighter <a href=#>Holly Holm</a> in Fight Valley.</p><p>Initially Serrano was not as interested in the sport, not even attending a family event to watch the Oscar De La Hoya vs. Félix Trinidad fight, but she was an avid follower of Cindy’s career and developed a passion for it as she grew older. When she graduated from Bushwick High School (located in Bushwick, Brooklyn and closed in 2006) at the age of 17, she decided to begin training as a method to buy things and bond with her sister. Her father supported her decision, but her mother was hesitant until she began earning success and saw it as a way for the elder sister to retire after having her second child. Cindy, knowing that she had already been frustrated during a previous sparring session against a boy, intended to dissuade her by stepping into the ring but the younger sister proved that she could defend herself competently. Admittedly shy, Serrano choose to continue in Maldonado’s small gym in Queens with him as trainer, so that the flow of people was controlled and she could focus on her training. Serrano’s amateur career was brief and concluded with a record of only 9–1, but she won the Staten Island amateur championship in 2008. From there she competed in the featherweight division of the New York Daily News Golden Gloves, where she defeated Glenyss Puentevella by referee stopping contest (RSC, the International Boxing Association’s equivalent of a technical knockout) in the semifinal and decisioned USA Boxing’s national champion Jody-Ann Weller in the final.</p><p>On June 11, 2011, Amanda defeated Jennifer Scott to capture the vacant NABF featherweight champion. The bout was scheduled for 8 rounds, but the match was cut quick by Serrano knocked out Scott in 1:04 in round 1.</p><p align=justify>She is the younger sister of Cindy Serrano, who is herself a multiple-time boxing world champion.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amanda Serrano</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Amanda</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Serrano</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1988</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Puerto Rico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cindy Serrano</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Amanda Serrano ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The first round was even, with both fighters attempting to do body work on the inside in center ring, but ineffectively. Connor also fought off the ropes with some right hand lead counters to the head, but Serrano was not fazed. In the second round, Serrano began landing power shots to the head, sending Connor to the canvas on her back midway through the round. Connor beat the count, but appeared helpless on the ropes as Serrano immediately battered her senseless and defenseless with numerous power shots to the head, forcing referee Benjy Esteves Jr. to stop the contest. Two minute rounds, scheduled for ten. According to Boxing 360 CEO Dr. Mario Yagobi, Serrano’s promoter, negotiations were underway for Serrano to fight an IBF-WBC unification match with WBC female Super Featherweight champion Frida Wallberg of Sweden in early 2012. Serrano sparred for this fight with her sister Cindy Serrano, training for her upcoming female world welterweight title bout with Anne Sophie Mathis. The Serrano sisters are both trained by Jordan Maldonado. Serrano’s originally scheduled opponent, Fatuma Zarika of Kenya, was unable to leave that country to get to the United States due to visa problems.</p><h2>Amanda Serrano Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Amanda Serrano is one of the <strong>richest Boxer</strong> from Puerto Rico.

After noting that “Ronda spars with boxing world champions that punch way harder than Cyborg”, Tarverdyan claimed that she “has never lost a round in the gym. A round. With boxing world champions”. Within a week, Serrano responded by stating that “Rousey’s trainer does not have any knowledge about the sport of boxing. She is a very good fighter in the Octagon, and I really congratulate her for everything she has done. Her opponents cannot box and it’s easy to look great, but when facing a high quality boxer with punching power as myself, believe me, things are gonna change. In a boxing ring, the canvas will be your comfort zone”.</p><p>Since early 2015, Serrano quietly worked towards debuting in mixed martial arts (MMA), beginning by incorporating kicks to her training. The idea emerged after she participated in the filming of Fight Valley along her sister, meeting Miesha Tate, Holly Holm, and Cristiane Justino and learned of the lifestyle that they could afford. This triggered the interest of people involved in MMA and she was approached and told about the economic potential of the move. When queried about the matter, Serrano expressed additional motivation due to the absence of a Puerto Rican female fighter in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) at the moment.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Amanda Serrano height</b> <strong>5 ft 5 in</strong> Amanda <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 5 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On April 27, 2012, Serrano faced the undefeated Frida Wallberg in Cloetta Center, Linkoping, Sweden.
