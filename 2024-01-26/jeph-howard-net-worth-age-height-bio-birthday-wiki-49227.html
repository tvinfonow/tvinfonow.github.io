Their self-titled debut album, produced by John Feldmann, was released on June 25, 2002 to critical acclaim. The album featured the singles: “The Taste of Ink”, “Buried Myself Alive”, and “Blue and Yellow”, with all three entering the charts and the album being certified platinum. they went on to play Warped Tour, Ozzfest, and Projekt Revolution, as well as Box Car Racer’s first and only tour.

Their second studio album was thus named In Love and Death, released as a reference to the tragedy McCracken dealt with during the recording. The song “Hard to Say” was a reference to McCracken’s ex-girlfriend; although the song was written years earlier, its dedication was only then declared. In Love and Death received very positive reviews and spawned three singles: “Take It Away”, “All That I’ve Got” (which earned them their first MuchMusic Video Award nomination), and “I Caught Fire”, before being re-released in 2005. “Under Pressure” (a Queen and David Bowie cover song performed with My Chemical Romance) was featured as a bonus track later pressings. The album has been certified platinum. After finishing up an international tour for the album, they took about eight months off before starting to work on their next album.</p><h2>Jeph Howard Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jeph Howard is one of the <strong>richest Bassist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jeph Howard</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He started playing bass to help one of his friends who was a guitarist.&nbsp;In 2001 the trio of him,&nbsp;He began playing bass to complement a friend of his who played guitar. In 2001, he, <a href=#>Quinn Allman</a>, and Brandon Steineckert formed the band, although Allman and Steineckert have both since left.&nbsp;along with Brandon Steineckert formed the band however Allman as well as Steineckert have since separated.</p><p align=justify>The band first created without a vocalist therefore they had auditions in Howard’s parents at their basement.</p><p align=justify>The Used formed in January 2001 with Branden Steineckert, Quinn Allman, Jeph Howard, and Bert McCracken. Before McCracken joined the band they only had music already prepared, but did not have lyrics and required a vocalist. They held auditions at Howard’s residence, but the band was not satisfied with any of the vocalists, describing the auditions as “terrible”. Allman then asked Bert McCracken if he was interested in joining the band. McCracken was impressed with the material the band had created. After being given music that the band had written, McCracken wrote the lyrics to what would become “Maybe Memories” and returned the next day to record a demo version of the song. McCracken was then officially confirmed as being the band’s vocalist. Throughout all of this, the band members suffered from poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse, panhandling for change in order to buy food. The members decided upon the name “Used” after friends claimed they felt “used” when contact with the band members waned as they became more engrossed in the project. The founder really liked the way McCracken could scream and as soon as he auditioned, McCracken was recording songs in his closet.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bassist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On September 12, 2006, the Used announced that Steineckert was no longer a member of the band. They said they felt they needed to move forward without him, and that there was a personality conflict between Steineckert and another band member. In late 2006, it was announced drummer Dan Whitesides of The New Transit Direction would replace Steineckert. Steineckert has since joined Rancid.</p><p>On February 6, 2007, they released a live album, Berth, which includes a DVD that features video of their performance at the Taste of Chaos 2005 tour in Vancouver and a CD that features it on audio. The DVD also includes a biography of the band and four music videos. The biography depicts the band after the release of Maybe Memories, leading into the creation of In Love and Death. The sale of Berth lead it to be certified as gold. They spent most of the early part of 2007 on the Taste of Chaos tour before their third album, Lies for the Liars, was released May 22, 2007. They headlined the Give It a Name festival. In June, they played the MuchMusic Video Awards for the first time ever, and received their second nomination for Best International Group Video, for “The Bird and the Worm”. They were scheduled to play Warped Tour in June and July, in support of their album, but were forced to cancel due to McCracken’s vocal cord surgery. After McCracken recovered, the band played the Reading and Leeds festivals in August, and went on to tour the United States in September. Lies for the Liars charted in the top five in more than seven countries, and featured the singles: “The Bird and the Worm” and “Pretty Handsome Awkward”. Although Whitesides had been chosen as the new drummer, Dean Butterworth of Good Charlotte recorded drums for the album. The six-month recording process was the longest the band had ever undertaken. Lies for the Liars generally received mixed to positive reviews. Originally, Lies for the Liars was expected to be a double-album. Nineteen songs were recorded, but they instead decided to save the songs for a future release. The album has been certified gold.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jeph Howard height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Jeph <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>They continued to write songs together and recorded a demo album in drummer Steineckert’s bedroom titled Demos from the Basement. Steineckert sent their songs to producer John Feldmann from the ska group Goldfinger. On hearing the song “A Box Full of Sharp Objects”, Feldman flew the band to Los Angeles on his own dime and helped them find a record label. They played for various record executives, but received little interest. Eventually, after sending copies of their demo to many record companies, they began to receive offers. They decided to sign to Reprise Records the first week of January 2002 which was only 1 year after the band had formed.</p><p align=justify>In April 2010, they cancelled their upcoming international tour dates and also began writing material for a follow up to Artwork. Recording and officially releasing the new album was significantly delayed after leaving Reprise Records—their record label group of ten years. According to Howard, “We were kind of waiting to see if we were going to do this record on Warner or not. We kind of had to wait and see what happened about that before we started recording.” They founded their own record label in 2011 after parting ways with Reprise Records, a division of Warner. The label was dubbed “Dental Records”, and they planned to release their fifth studio album Vulnerable in February 2012 on it.</p><h2>Who is Jeph Howard Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jeph Howard</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

It was only released on digital music stores and it has charted No.&nbsp;14 on iTunes’ Top 100 albums. They worked on Artwork, their fourth studio album, throughout 2008. They took several breaks while working on the album to headline the inaugural Get a Life Tour and the Spare the Air Festival in California. The album was produced by Panic! at the Disco’s producer Matt Squire, making this their first studio album not produced by John Feldmann. It was also their first studio album to feature Whitesides as the drummer. In Alternative Press, McCracken stated “In the past, we’ve always kind of brought pop sensibility into heavy rock, but this is going to be all that much more tantalizing and brutal. Our songs are ten times messier and noisier than they’ve ever been.” McCracken explained the meaning of the album, saying, “This record is about coming to grips with how much you really hate yourself and knowing you can never hate yourself to the full extent, so you’re free to hate yourself as much as you want to”. McCracken went on to say “we [have not] been this excited about an album since our self titled back in 2002.” The album released along with a DVD for the pre-order and first run of the album in stores. A cover version of “Burning Down the House” by the Talking Heads was released on the cover compilation album Covered, A Revolution in Sound, and was also featured in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – The Album. They played at The Bamboozle in May 2009. The single “Blood on My Hands” was released on iTunes in June, and was streamable for one day on the band’s website. On July 21, the pre-order was available. Artwork became available worldwide on August 31, 2009. The band played a major U.S. tour in October and November 2009 with supporting bands The Almost and Drive A, and another in early 2010 with Atreyu and Drive A. They later joined an arena tour supporting Three Days Grace in Canada. The band premiered the music video for the song “Empty with You” on December 9, 2009 via Twitter.
