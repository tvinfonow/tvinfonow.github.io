He is the son of JoAnn, a North Hollywood native, and Erwin Krekorian, a Marine Corps WWII veteran. His father was of Armenian descent and ran a small business on Saticoy Street in Van Nuys. Krekorian completed his primary education entirely within the Los Angeles Unified School District, graduating from Cleveland High School (Los Angeles, California) in Reseda. As the first member of his family to attend college, Krekorian enrolled in the University of Southern California, where he first became active in political causes. He worked with then-Assemblyman Tom Bane, became the campus organizer for Jerry Brown’s 1978 gubernatorial campaign and helped lead USC’s Democratic student group. After graduating with a B.A. degree in Political Science from USC, Krekorian went on to earn a J.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. Krekorian became an organizer for Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and co-chaired the Saxophone Club, the Democratic National Committee’s nationwide young professionals group.</p><p>Krekorian practiced law, with a focus on business, entertainment and intellectual property litigation, at the firms Skadden Arps, Dewey Ballantine and Leopold, Petrich & Smith and Fisher & Krekorian, where he was a name partner. He served on the Board of Trustees of the LA County Bar Association, the Board of Trustees of the LA County Law Library and the California State Legislature’s Task Force on Court Facilities. In the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Krekorian was counsel to the Webster Commission and was appointed to the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission. Krekorian has been praised for his efforts in preserving women’s rights for his pro bono work in the fight against domestic violence, and a program he developed for at-risk youth, called GenerationNext.

During his first term in office, Krekorian held one of the best records in the Assembly with the highest number of bills signed into law by any freshman legislator. He was named Assistant Majority Floor Leader of the State Assembly, the third ranking leadership position in the Assembly, by then-Speaker Karen Bass. Krekorian’s legislative priorities included making government more accessible and responsive, saving and creating jobs, protecting the environment and increasing public safety. He created the “Government at Your Doorstep” program in response to complaints about speeding, graffiti and noise pollution in his district. As the state battled to pass a balanced budget in early 2009, Krekorian authored a historic bill to ensure film and TV production in California stays local. His bill was the first successful tax incentive aimed at saving California jobs by addressing runaway production. On-location feature production increased 9.1 percent in the second quarter of 2012, generating 160 production days in Southern California. Krekorian also introduced legislation that restricted plastic pollution in ocean run-off, expanded renewable energy generation for California public utilities and reduced carbon emissions. He worked closely with local police departments to reduce gang violence, along with crime in his district and throughout the state. In his first Assembly term, Krekorian’s Weapons and Ammunition Nuisance Abatement Act of 2007 gave apartment owners greater latitude to evict tenants who harbor guns and ammo. That year, Krekorian also introduced and passed a bill to encourage participation with federal authorities to siphon off the state’s stock of weapons.</p><h2>Paul Krekorian Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Paul Krekorian is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States.

He is the Chair of the city’s Budget and Finance Committee and the Ad Hoc Committee on Job Creation, the Vice Chair of the Housing Committee, and sits on the Energy, Climate Change and Environmental Justice Committee, Trade, Travel and Tourism Committee, Executive Employee Relations Committee and the Board of Referred Powers. He also serves on the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and Metrolink (Southern California), and sits on the San Fernando Valley Council of Governments, a coalition of leaders advocating for the Valley’s two million residents. His campaign officially began on July 10, 2009, when Krekorian officially announced his candidacy to fill the vacant District 2 seat in a special election. The primary was held on September 22, in which Krekorian placed first with 34% of the vote. A run-off was scheduled for December 8 and, aided by support from a number of public safety, environmental and Democratic groups, including Los Angeles Daily News, the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City, the Los Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley, Krekorian soundly defeated Christine Essel with more than 56% of the vote, despite being outspent 2-1 in overall campaign dollars and 13-1 in third-party political committee donations.</p><p>Since before was first elected to public office, Krekorian has worked tirelessly to support the restoration of damaged ecosystems, fight global warming, prevent air pollution and promote sustainable development for our city and state. As a City Councilmember, his strong advocacy for sound environmental policies led the way for Los Angeles to become the largest city to ban single-use plastic bags and to prioritize revitalizing the LA River. Krekorian has also opened parks throughout Council District 2, pushed for the city to use and implement green technology and practices, acted to preserve our urban forest and protected our open space. Highlighting his independence, the councilman repeatedly stood with city ratepayers and led the fight against proposed rate increases sought by the Dept. of Water and Power in 2010. In an open letter to constituents explaining his opposition, Krekorian lambasted the Department’s lack of transparency and insufficient justification. “I voted against the DWP’s proposal because I wanted to make clear that any rate hikes proposed by the Department must be vetted in the most responsible and transparent fashion,” he wrote. Krekorian worked to ensure that a ratepayer advocate – an independent voice for Angelenos on DWP issues – became a reality. In 2017, Krekorian authored a motion that made Los Angeles the largest city in the United States to set a goal of reaching 100% renewable energy use.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Krekorian height</b> Not available right now.

Concurrently, Krekorian served as president of the Five Star Education Coalition, a consortium of five suburban school districts that worked to shape state and federal education policy.</p><p align=justify>Since taking office in January 2010, Krekorian has worked to improve the city’s finances, ensure government transparency, preserve open space, and restore confidence in local government.

Paul Krekorian celebrates birthday on March 24 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 2012, Councilmember Krekorian was tapped to lead the Budget and Finance Committee, inheriting the responsibility of overseeing a multi-billion dollar General Fund budget. He has been a fiscal watchdog for the city and is responsible for reforming LA’s finances and putting the city on a path to economic recovery. “With every great challenge there is great opportunity, and we must seize this chance to create a municipal government that effectively and efficiently provides the services our residents need and deserve,” Councilmember Krekorian said at the time. “How we respond to this time of crisis will define Los Angeles for years to come, and the work we do now can and must create a firm foundation upon which to build a strong future for our city.” Since taking the helm, he has taken a “difficult but responsible approach to solving a $220 million deficit and enhancing the city’s solvency.” When Krekorian took office in 2010, the projected deficit for fiscal year 2014-2015 was more than $1 billion. Since then, he has helped the city reduce costs by more than $800 million, nearly eliminating the entire structural deficit. Under his leadership, the city has also established the highest reserve fund in decades. Krekorian has also made improvements to the budget that benefit our neighborhoods by investing in infrastructure, public safety and people. He has restored needed funds to the Los Angeles Fire Dept., improved library hours, and directed funding toward sidewalk repair, tree trimming, graffiti abatement, neighborhood beautification projects, cleaning up illegally dumped items, and senior and student programs at our city’s parks.</p><h3>Where does Paul Krekorian live?</h3><p>Krekorian lives in the <b>San Fernando Valley</b> with his wife, Tamar, and children Hrag, Andrew and Lori.</p><h3>How do I contact Paul Krekorian?</h3><p>To discuss a neighborhood issue, concern or leave a comment, please <b>fill out the form above or email <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=afdfcedac381c4ddcac4c0ddc6cec1efc3ceccc6dbd681c0ddc8>[email&nbsp;protected]</a></b>.</p><h3>Who is the mayor of North Hollywood?</h3><p>Mayor Garcetti Opens New Plaza In North Hollywood Arts District Mayor <b>Eric Garcetti</b> today opened the NoHo Plaza, a new public space in the heart of the North Hollywood Arts District and the first project of the “People St” program.</p><h3>What council district is Studio City in?</h3><p><b>Council District 2</b> includes the communities of North Hollywood, Studio City, Sun Valley, Valley Glen, Valley Village, Van Nuys and Toluca Lake.
