He was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 36th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft, but chose to stay close to home and played his collegiate baseball at Galveston College where he earned third-team All-America honors in 1998. Primarily an infielder, he pitched only 26 total innings for the Whitecaps. Other notable Whitecap players on Backe’s team included Pete Orr and Seth Foreman.</p><p>Backe was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 18th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. During his first three seasons in the minor leagues, he played every infield and outfield position. In fact, the two innings that he pitched for the rookie league Princeton Devil Rays in 1998 were the only time he spent on the mound during that time. In spite of his steady glove and versatility, it was clear that a light-hitting utility player had a very small chance of making the major leagues. In 2001, he changed positions to pitcher and found immediate success. He rose through the ranks of the pitching-depleted Tampa Bay system climbing from Single-A to the major leagues in just a season and a half.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brandon Backe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brendan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steele</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Galveston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dana Kohler Backe</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brandon Backe ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
