The houseguest’s learned it was Fast-Forward eviction night, and after Daniele was evicted, Kalia became the new Head of Household and nominated Jeff and Rachel for eviction. Jeff was unable to win the veto, and Shelly voted to evict Jeff, forcing a tie, which Kalia broke in Rachel’s favor, resulting in Jeff’s eviction. Jordan furiously declared the end of her friendship with Shelly, losing her temper in a rare moment of anger. With Porsche now in power, Rachel and Jordan felt doomed, but were given a chance of reprieve when Porsche opened Pandora’s Box, re-activating the Duos twist for one week. Jordan paired up with Rachel, and despite initially being nominated as a pair, Rachel won the Veto, and used it on herself and Jordan, essentially giving them the choice of whom to evict from the two replacement nominees – Adam and Shelly. One week after Jeff’s eviction, Jordan and Rachel chose to take revenge on Shelly, evicting her in a 2-1 vote. Rachel then proceeded to win the next Head of Household competition, and despite Adam having the ability to use his Veto to put Jordan in a position of certain eviction, he chose to maintain his long-standing alliance with Jordan, pushing her into the final four. Wanting to keep her early deal with nominated houseguest Kalia, Jordan voted to evict Porsche on eviction night, aware that Rachel would break the resultant tie and evict Kalia anyway. The following week, Jordan narrowly lost the power position to Adam by a single point, and lost the Veto to Porsche, who also gained the sole power to choose who to evict of Jordan and Rachel. Jordan’s choice to vote to evict Porsche two days previously came back to haunt her, and she was evicted from the game for the first time, after 69 days in the house. Jordan voted for Rachel to win Big Brother 13.</p><p>Things began to turn in Jordan’s favor in the fourth week of the show, when during a key Head of Household competition, Jeff struck a deal with Russell Kairouz, guaranteeing safety for himself and Jordan if he allowed Russell to win the competition. This allowed Russell to target and evict Ronnie. In the same week, Jeff won a public vote, and was secretly awarded the coup d’état – the power to overthrow a Head of Household and change the nominations. Jeff opted to use the power during Chima’s Head of Household reign the week after Ronnie’s Eviction, saving Russell from eviction, and condemning Jessie to the jury.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jordan Lloyd height</b> Not available right now.
