Carol Patricia Mas (born October 20, 1956), also known professionally as Carolyne Mas is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist.&nbsp;Along with Willie Nile, Steve Forbert, and The Roches, she broke through the Greenwich Village music boom in the late 1970s.&nbsp;In 1977, she founded the Cornelia Street Cafe’s Songwriter’s Workshop. Later, the Songwriter’s Exchange was established with singer-songwriters like Jack Hardy and Suzanne Vega.&nbsp;She is still relatively unknown in America, aside from a small group of loyal fans. However, her popularity in Europe, Canada and elsewhere was largely due to the widespread use of television in these markets as a promotion tool.&nbsp;Although her records were well-received in Canada, her greatest success was in Germany where Phonogram released Mas Hysteria, a live album.&nbsp;The album was originally meant to promote her January 1981 appearance on Rockpalast and featured her most important hit, “Sittin’ in the Dark”.</p><p>Mas reunited in 1999 with Steve Burgh (1950-2005), a producer-guitarist who produced her first two albums, Carolyne Mas, and Hold On. She was previously signed to Mercury Records 20 years earlier.&nbsp;The two recorded an entire album at Burgh’s Baby Monster studio in New York City.&nbsp;For these sessions she was also reunited with keyboardist Giordano and guitarist-keyboardist Charlton Pettus.&nbsp;Mas released the album, Brand New World, in 2005 as a tribute to Burgh.</p><p>Although semi-retired from the music business, Mas occasionally performs in New York City, Germany, and Italy, where she released a studio album entitled Across the River on Italian label Route 61 Music in October 2013. Currently, she is enrolled at ASU to pursue a Master of Science in Medical Nutrition and will graduate from grad school in 2021.
