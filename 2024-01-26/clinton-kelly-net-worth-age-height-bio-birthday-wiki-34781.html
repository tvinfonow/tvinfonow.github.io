After three auditions, Kelly was chosen as the new co-host, alongside Stacy London. He has described their relationship as “a brother and sister in the backseat of a car on a long car trip”. The premise was to help participants refresh their wardrobes, and get them to look – and feel – better. Though makeover shows typically focus on the final look of the participant, this show highlighted the internal change and confidence participants gained during the makeover process. Kelly often asked contributors if their clothes made them feel beautiful and the majority of contributors admitted that they did not. Kelly said of the ultimate purpose of the show:</p><p>Kelly is openly gay, but in comparing What Not to Wear with the show Queer Eye—which pioneered gay men making over people seen as needing fashion advice—the Washington Blade noted some key differences: “[U]nless you have your gaydar on while watching the show, you would have no idea. There’s nothing ‘gay’ about the show and he doesn’t really talk about it on air. Viewers trust Kelly’s expertise based on the strength of his choices rather than on the ‘he’s gay and he should know’ fashion theory.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Clinton Kelly height</b> <strong>6 ft 4 in</strong> Clinton <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 4 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Kelly became the moderator of the ABC daytime show The Chew in 2011.
