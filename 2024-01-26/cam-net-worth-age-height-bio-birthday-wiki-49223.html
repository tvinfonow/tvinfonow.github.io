Who is Cam dating now & how much money does Cam have?</p><h2>Cam Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Cam</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>November 19, 1984</strong> in Huntington Beach, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Cam was born in Huntington Beach on November 18, 1984. She was raised in Lafayette in California, a suburb of the San Francisco Bay Area.&nbsp;Cam also spent time in Oceanside where her grandparents ran a ranch.&nbsp;Cam was influenced by country music and they encouraged her to listen to it and perform it often.&nbsp;She sang in many choral groups throughout high school and college.&nbsp;She was a member of the Contra Costa Children’s Chorus where she learned 14 languages.&nbsp;As an undergraduate student, she studied psychology at the University of California, Davis.&nbsp;While studying in the Netherlands, she joined an all-female college a cappella group called The Spokes. She also learned how to play the guitar.&nbsp;On a trip to Nepal, she gained confidence playing the guitar.&nbsp;She took up residence in a remote mountain community for several weeks, with no electricity or basic needs. She also made friends with Canadian musicians and began playing the guitar more often.&nbsp;Cam said that her confidence in playing guitar increased after the trip.</p><p>Cam moved quickly to Los Angeles, California and began working with Tyler Johnson, songwriter and producer.&nbsp;In an effort to attract Faith Hill to her music, she recorded demos with Johnson. The recordings were eventually heard by Tim McGraw’s manager.&nbsp;Cut to Impress, Maggie Rose’s 2013 debut album, featured her song “Fall Madly In Love With You”.&nbsp;Miley Cyrus also recorded “Maybe You’re Right”, one of Cam’s songs on her 2013 album Bangerz.&nbsp;These songs were a huge success and she moved to Nashville, Tennessee to continue writing music. She turned down a publishing contract to be able to make her own music.&nbsp;In 2013, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to create 10 songs with Johnson.&nbsp;Jeff Bhasker, a producer best known for his work in collaboration with artists like P!nk, fun., Bruno Mars and Beyonce, supported the campaign.&nbsp;Cam also toured Denmark and Sweden in the same year with Karavan’s Helsingborg group, after previously working with Anders Mouridsen while in Los Angeles.</p><p>Cam was exposed to classic country music at an early age from the time spent on her grandparents’ ranch. They introduced her to the musical sounds of Patsy Cline, Bonnie Raitt and Willie Nelson. She was largely influenced by the vocal phrasing of Cline and Ray Charles. She also developed an appreciation for the Dixie Chicks and the Indigo Girls, commenting that she was “so into those female harmonies”. She additionally cites Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Randy Newman as influences on her songwriting style. Although she has a variety of musical influences, Cam stated that country music is where she felt most connected to. In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, she explained her reasoning: “I grew up singing in a lot of different languages and a lot of world music choirs, so I have a lot of musical influences. But the songwriting structure of country music is the standard in my mind. … That structure seems to feel the most homey to me.”</p><p>“Burning House” served as her next single. She performed the song live on the radio program The Bobby Bones Show, which attracted and fueled attention to the song. Sony Music Entertainment, of which Arista Nashville is a division, then arranged a meeting and decided to release the track as a single on June 16, 2015 after the song had initial success on the iTunes charts. “Burning House” became a top-five hit on the Billboard country songs and country airplay charts. It also was the highest-selling female country song of 2015, selling more than 500,000 copies in the United States. In addition, the song received a nomination from the 2016 Grammy Awards. The success of the song led to the release of her first Arista Nashville album Untamed on December 11, 2015. Also produced largely by Bhasker and Johnson, it consisted of 11 tracks all co-written by Cam, including all of the songs from the EP. It debuted at number two on the Top Country Albums chart and was the highest-selling debut country studio album of 2015. Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 15 on their list of the “40 Best Country Albums of 2015”. The magazine commented, “For an artist at the start of career, Cam already sounds like one of the most secure in the game.” “Mayday” was released as the album’s third single in February 2016. It was a minor Top 40 hit on the country charts, peaking at number 36 on Billboard Country Airplay.</p><p align=justify>Cam released “Down This Road”, a single, in 2013, with Lindsay Marias as his manager.&nbsp;Michael Bryan, a local radio director discovered the song through an Instagram photo and played it on air.&nbsp;Cam claims that the single’s radio airplay helped her decide which label to sign with.&nbsp;She met Doug Morris, director of Sony Music Entertainment.&nbsp;To meet him, she flew to New York City’s headquarters of Sony Music Entertainment.&nbsp;She sang “Burning House”, a song she’d been working on, using only an acoustic instrument.&nbsp;Morris began to hum along to the chorus, and he stated that this was the reason why he got into the music industry.&nbsp;Later, he would ask Morris to perform the song at his Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony.&nbsp;Soon after signing, she was signed to Sony’s country division Arista Nashville in 2014. She toured the nation with Dan + Shay that year on their Where It All Began tour.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cam</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1984</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Huntington Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lucy Marvel Weaver</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Cam ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
