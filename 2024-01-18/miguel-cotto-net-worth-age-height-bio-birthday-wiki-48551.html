Who is Miguel Cotto dating now & how much money does Miguel Cotto have?</p><h2>Miguel Cotto Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Miguel Cotto</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Boxer</strong> who was born on <strong>October 29, 1980</strong> in Rhode Island, <strong>United States</strong>. He was the first Puerto Rican fighter to win four weight divisions of the world title.&nbsp;The Ring magazine ranked him as the third-best light middleweight in the world in 2017.</p><p>In 2007, he defeated&nbsp;Shane Mosely&nbsp;with a unanimous decision.</p><p>On May 18, 2017, sources confirmed that Cotto had parted ways with promoter Roc Nation Sports. One of the main reasons for the split was due to not having an opponent lined up even though he mentioned 2017 would be his last year in the sport and he would like to have had two fights. A fight with Japanese boxer Yoshihiro Kamegai (27-3-2, 24 KOs) was penciled in for June 24, but fell through. HBO also did not back the fight.</p><p>On July 6, 2013, it was announced that Cotto would next fight light middleweight contender Delvin Rodríguez (28-6-3, 16 KOs) in a bout promoted by Top Rank. It would mark the first time Cotto would fight under the Top Rank banner since his contract expired in December 2011. Cotto recruited Hall of Famer Freddie Roach as head trainer. The bout was scheduled for October 5 with the venue likely being in Florida. The Amway Center in Orlando was later confirmed as the venue and the fight was made official on July 23 at the Disney Atrium. An attendance of 11,912 was announced. Cotto looked like the Cotto of old, by displaying an aggressive style early on in the fight and landing powerful body shots. One punch in his arsenal that was brought back to life, was the vicious left hook which he was known for in his days of dominance in the junior welterweight and welterweight divisions. The second round saw Cotto landing body shots at will and with less than 10 seconds left in the round he staggered Rodríguez with a sharp left hook. In the beginning of the third round, with Rodríguez still feeling the effects of the left hook at the end of round two, Cotto forced Rodríguez in to the ropes landed a left hook to the temple, followed by flurry of punches which knocked Rodríguez onto the canvas. The referee then stopped the fight and gave Cotto a third-round TKO victory. Over the course of the fight, Cotto landed 55 of 110 punches thrown (50%), 47 of which were power punches and Rodríguez landed 16 of his 68 thrown (24%). The fight averaged 1.555 million viewers on HBO, the highest rating for 2013.</p><p align=justify>In 2008, he married Melissa Guzman; they have a daughter called Alondra and a boy named Miguel III.&nbsp;His brother&nbsp;He married Melissa Guzman in 2008; they have a daughter named Alondra and a son named Miguel III.
