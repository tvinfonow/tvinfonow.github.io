Who is Hirving Lozano dating now & how much money does Hirving Lozano have?</p><h2>Hirving Lozano Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Hirving Lozano</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Soccer Player</strong> who was born on <strong>July 30, 1995</strong> in Mexico City, <strong>Mexico</strong>. Mexican right winger, who made his La Liga debut in 2014 with CF Pachuca.&nbsp;In 2017, he signed with PSV Eindhoven, and in August 2019, began playing for Napoli.</p><p>He was a teammate with defender&nbsp;Aquivaldo Moquera&nbsp;at CF Pachuca.</p><p>Lozano’s style of play has been described as: “Playing on the left side of a 4–2–3–1 the vast majority of the time, right-footed Lozano has all the attributes of a classic inverted winger. Possessing great power in his right foot, he’s often dangerous when shooting after cutting in from the left-hand side. […] [He] is equally adept at creating chances as well as scoring them, with a strong left-foot he’s able to deliver crosses after taking the ball down the line, although he elects to cut inside more often than choosing to go outside the opposition full-back. Lozano also has quite good creative vision, particularly for a 20 year-old.” He has also been described as being “[q]uick with or without the ball and possessing a powerful and accurate shot.” Although more widely known for his offensive prowess, he also offers a high defensive work rate through his speed and constant pressing on the ball when not in possession, willing to chase down loose balls and often forcing defenders and goalkeepers to clear the ball long, allowing his team to win the ball back quickly, or even managing to steal the ball, as a result, he was PSV’s highest-pressing player during his stay at the Dutch club. As a result of his diminutive stature and agile playing style, he is often the victim of various fouls, at one point becoming the most-fouled-on player in various seasons of the Liga MX.</p><p>On 15 September, he would score two goals against ADO in a 7–0 thrashing, with former Pachuca teammate Érick Gutiérrez contributing the assist for the second goal three minutes after being substituted in. Three days later, he made his UEFA Champions League group stage debut against Barcelona, playing all ninety minutes in PSV’s 4–0 defeat. Lozano scored another brace on 6 October against VVV, scoring the first and final goal in PSV’s 4–0 victory. On 20 October, he was directly involved in half of PSV’s goals in their 6–0 victory over FC Emmen, contributing two assists and one goal. Four days later, he scored his first goal in the Champions League group stage as PSV drew 2–2 with Tottenham Hotspur, also managing to send Hugo Lloris off with a red card due to an outside-of-the-box infraction. On 24 November, Lozano would score twice and provide an assist in PSV’s 3–0 victory over SC Heerenveen. Lozano scored in PSV’s 1–1 draw with Inter Milan in the final group stage match of the Champions League on 11 December. He was subsequently named in the Champions League breakthrough team of 2018.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Mexico City.&nbsp;Chucky was his nickname.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hirving Lozano</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hirving</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lozano</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1995</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jesús Lozano, Ana María Bahena</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bryan Mauricio Lozano Bahena</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ana Obregon</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Hirving Lozano ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
