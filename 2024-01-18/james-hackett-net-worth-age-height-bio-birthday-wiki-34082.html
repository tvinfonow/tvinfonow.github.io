James Patrick “Jim” Hackett (born April 22, 1955) is an American businessman. He is the president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Company.</p><p>In 2013, Hackett joined the Ford Motor Company’s board of directors. He served on its Sustainability and Innovation Committee and the Audit and the Nominating and Governance committees.</p><p>On May 22, 2017, Hackett succeeded Mark Fields as president and CEO of Ford Motor Company. He is also a member of the company’s board of directors. The move came as Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company’s declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10 percent reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018.</p><p>In January 2019, Hackett sent an email to Ford employees that read, “2018 was mediocre by any standard. Yes, we made $7 billion last year. But think of it this way: this represents a 4.4 percent operating margin, about half what we believe is an appropriate margin. So we are aiming for much closer to $14 billion.”</p><p align=justify>Hackett spent thirty years with the Grand Rapids-based office furniture company Steelcase. He joined Steelcase in 1981, holding a variety of sales and marketing positions. In 1994, Hackett was named CEO at age 39, making him the youngest leader in the history of the company. He held the position for nearly twenty years before retiring in 2014. During his tenure, Steelcase eliminated nearly 12,000 employees as part of a downsizing and restructuring of the business; he also led the company to acquire a majority stake in IDEO in 1996. During this time Hackett became a proponent of design thinking, which focuses on how humans experience a product. Hackett stayed on as vice chairman of the company from 2014 to 2015.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James Hackett</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>James</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Columbus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Columbus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>James Hackett ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
