With 23 wickets in 4 matches, he was selected for the Irani Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Wills Trophy matches.</p><h2>Kapil Dev Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kapil Dev is one of the <strong>richest Cricket Player</strong> from India. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Kapil Dev</b>'s net worth <strong>$30 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He first began playing for the local team of cricket, Haryana, in 1975 at the age of sixteen.&nbsp;He made his first Test appearance in the year 1978.</p><p align=justify>He was captain of India to victory in the 1983 Cricket World Cup.&nbsp;He was chosen as an inductee into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in the year 2010.</p><p align=justify>Dev was born as Kapil Dev Nikhanj to his father Ram Lal Nikhanj, a prominent timber merchant and to his mother, Raj Kumari Ram Lal Nikhanj in Chandigarh on 6 January 1959. His mother was born in Pakpattan, in the town of the Sufi saint Baba Farid. His father was from Dipalpur. They lived in Shah Yakka which is now in Okara district, Pakistan.

Although his match figures were unimpressive, the numbers did not convey any measure of his contribution. He startled the Pakistani batsmen with his pace and bouncers that struck their helmets on more than one occasion. Dev captured his maiden wicket of Sadiq Mohammad with his trademark outswinger. He showcased his all-rounder talent when he scored India’s fastest Test half-century off 33 balls and 2 sixes in each of the innings during the 3rd Test match at National Stadium, Karachi, although India lost the match and the series 2–0. In the ensuing series against a visiting West Indies team, he scored his maiden Test century (126) at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi in just 124 balls and had a steady bowling performance (17 wickets at 33.00). Ominous signs of Dev’s liking for England showed up in the ensuring series, his first outside the sub-continent. He picked up his first 5-wicket haul and all of England’s wickets, although it came at a huge cost (48 overs and 146 runs conceded) as England scored a mammoth 633 and won the match comfortably. Dev finished the series with 16 wickets though his batting haul of 45 runs (Average: 7.5) was unimpressive. His debut in ODI Cricket happened in the earlier tour of Pakistan where his individual performance was ordinary and it stayed the same as both Dev and India had a poor campaign at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.</p><p>In the 1978–79 season, Haryana had a repeat encounter with Bengal in the pre-quarterfinal match after a lackluster season from Dev (12 wickets from 4 matches). He scored 2 half-centuries in the group stage matches. In the pre-quarterfinal match, he took a 5-wicket haul in the first innings. Poor batting by Haryana in the second innings let Bengal avenge their loss from 2 seasons back by scoring the required 161 runs for the loss of just 4 wickets. Dev stood out in the Irani Trophy match, scoring 62 runs and coming in at number 8. He took 5 catches in the game where Karnataka was defeated by the Rest of India XI. Dev arrived in the national spotlight with a standout performance in the finals of the Duleep Trophy, taking a first-innings haul of 7/65 in 24 overs. He was included in the North Zone squad for Deodhar Trophy and Wills Trophy for the first time. He played his first Test match in the season against Pakistan.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kapil Dev height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Kapil <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the 1976–77 season opener against Jammu & Kashmir, he had a match haul of 8/36 in the win. While his contribution for the rest of that season was ordinary, Haryana qualified for the pre-quarterfinals. Dev achieved his then best innings haul of 8/20 in just 9 overs in the second innings to skittle Bengal for 58 runs in under 19 overs. Haryana lost to Bombay in the quarter-finals.</p><p align=justify>In the 1979–80 season, Dev showed his batting talent with a maiden century against Delhi when he scored his career-best 193. In the pre-quarterfinal match, where he captained Haryana for the first time against Uttar Pradesh, he took a five-wicket haul in the second innings to advance to quarterfinals, where they lost to Karnataka. With Dev cementing his place in the Indian national squad, his appearances in domestic matches dwindled.</p><h2>Who is Kapil Dev Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> married to <strong>Romi Bhatia </strong>.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in India</strong>. Kapil Dev celebrates birthday on January 6 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Dev was a fast bowler. However, a fluent run-up and a gather that was perfectly side-on at the time of delivery meant that the outswinger came naturally to him. Usually bowled at a length and direction that always troubled right-handers, his delivery was the bane of most of his victims as he sought to beat the bat on the outside edge, either caught on the off-side cordon or indeed LBW and bowled in case the ball missed the edge. The side-on action meant that, for the first few years, this was the only delivery he could bowl. The deliveries that held their lines or came into the right-hander came through natural variations off the pitch. However, as he gained maturity, the action became less side-on and he developed an inswinger too. He noted in the mid-1980s that the only delivery he could not bowl at will was the leg-cutter.</p><h3>What is the monthly income of Kapil Dev?</h3><table readability=1><tr>Net Worth:$30 Million</tr><tr readability=2><td>Net Worth In Indian Rupees:</td><td>220 Crore INR</td></tr><tr><td>Salary:</td><td>12 Crore +</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly Income:</td><td><b>1 Crore</b> +</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth:</td><td>January 6, 1959</td></tr></table><h3>Did Kapil used mongoose bat?</h3><p>However, <b>the bat Kapil uses was just known as a Slazenger WG bat at that point (no mention of any mongoose)</b>, a new ‘shoulder-less model’ the bat company had come up with.
