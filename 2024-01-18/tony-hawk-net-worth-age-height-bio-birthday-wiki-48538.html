According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Tony Hawk</b>'s net worth <strong>$140 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>After striking out in a little league game, he hid out in a ravine until his father came to get him. He won many skateboard competitions as a child, and became a professional when he was 14.</p><p align=justify>He was nicknamed The Birdman for his aerial stunts, and gained fame for becoming first skater to successfully land a 900 degree spin out of a half pipe.</p><p align=justify>Tony Hawk was born on May 12, 1968 in San Diego, California to Nancy and Frank Peter Rupert Hawk, and was raised in San Diego. As a child, Hawk was described as “hyperactive”, and his mother has stated that he was “so hard on himself and expected himself to do so many things.” One time, Hawk struck out in baseball and was so distraught that he hid in a ravine and had to be “physically coaxed out” by his father. His frustration with himself was so harsh that his parents had him psychologically evaluated at school. The results were that Tony was “gifted”, as he was tested with an intelligence quotient of 144, so school advisers recommended placing him in advanced classes. Hawk attended Jean Farb Middle School from 1980 to 1981, and eventually returned for the show Homecoming with Rick Reilly, where he set up a ramp and did a demonstration. His parents supported his skateboarding because it served as an outlet for his excessive energy. As Hawk’s skills developed, he became a professional skateboarder at age fourteen, and was the National Skateboard Association world champion for twelve consecutive years.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$140 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Skateboarder</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A video game series based on his skateboarding, with the title Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, debuted in 1999.
