Who is Dennis Condrey dating now & how much money does Dennis Condrey have?</p><h2>Dennis Condrey Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Dennis Condrey</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Wrestler</strong> who was born on <strong>February 1, 1952</strong> in Florence, Alabama, <strong>United States</strong>. Dennis Condrey (born February 1 1952) is an American retired professional wrestler.&nbsp;Most famous for his participation in his organizations the Continental Wrestling Association, Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>They would beat Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee to claim their AWA World Tag Team titles on October 30, 1987 at Whitewater, WI.&nbsp;They would then enjoy an entire two months of title reign before losing the title to the return of the Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) on the 27th of December 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>Condrey returned to Alabama (now known as Continental) in the Spring of 1989. On July 22, 1989, Condrey defeated Tom Prichard to win the CWF Heavyweight Championship, before losing the title back to Prichard on December 6. He would also form a short-lived tag team called the “Lethal Weapons” with Doug Gilbert. Together, they went to the New England area to wrestle for International Championship Wrestling. On December 30, 1989, they defeated Phil Apollo and Vic Steamboat, who was subbing for Apollo’s partner Eric Sbraccia, who no-showed, to win the ICW Tag Team Championship. They held onto the belts until March 1990, when they left the promotion. Condrey retired shortly thereafter.</p><p>The teams wrestled at Starrcade ’88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in the NWA for months, building up to a 6-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per-view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, due to changes in ownership, the NWA was going through booking upheaval with Dusty Rhodes being replaced as head booker by George Scott. Jim Crockett, Jr. already had a problem with Condrey due to his previous overnight disappearance and Scott had previous animosity with Rose, so Scott’s appearance as top booker made for the catalyst to bury both teams and the feud. The feud was cooled off and the “loser leaves town” match was going to be used to kick one of them out of the territory once and for all and continue to bury the other. At the last minute, Dennis Condrey once again decided to leave the NWA, rather than take his PPV payoff and give Crockett and Scott the satisfaction. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward.</p><p align=justify>In the early part of the year 1986 Condrey along with Eaton took home the World Tag Team Championships with the Rock ‘n’ roll Express Superstars on the Superstation in early 1986. The two became feuding until Condrey was forced to leave the organization in the early part of 1987.&nbsp;Condrey left the organization in the night, without giving any notice or notice to Cornette, Eaton, or the NWA.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dennis Condrey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dennis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Condrey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florence</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alabama</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Dennis Condrey ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
