American composer, multi-instrumentalist, and singer.&nbsp;He is best known for his role as the lead vocalist, keyboardist and co-founder of the group Savatage.&nbsp;He also was part of the team that created music with Trans-Siberian Orchestra.</p><p>As the founding member of Savatage the band, he is considered in the context of other members of the band, including&nbsp;As a founding member of Savatage, he can be seen in relation to other band members including <a href=#>Chris Caffery</a> and <a href=#>Al Pitrelli</a>.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Al Pitrelli.</p><p>Jon and Criss’s family moved around a lot during their childhood, living in California for four years until moving to Florida with his family in 1976. Much like his brother Criss, Jon found music his calling during the family’s time in California. Starting off with his father’s piano, Jon dabbled in guitars, pianos and drums before buying “a really ugly bass”. Jon and Criss continued their musical exploits and played a block party, playing Kiss, Deep Purple and ZZ Top covers. Although originally the guitar player of the brothers, Jon quickly realized Criss’s talent was superior to his and stuck to singing and swapped with his brother and played bass.</p><p>Jon and Criss re-united to form Avatar, out of their two most recent bands, Alien and Tower respectively. Avatar would later become Savatage. Earning the envy of most other Floridan bands due to their “awesome equipment”, Avatar was originally a five-piece, with Jon on drums and vocals, and Criss on guitar. The band slowly drifted apart until Jon and Criss remained, and the two got jobs at “The Pit”, a practice shack where they met Steve Wacholz. Wacholz was very familiar with the Oliva brothers, who he first met in 1977. He saw Criss play at a local high school and was blown away. Very soon after, he auditioned for Jon’s band, Alien. When he got to the audition, Wacholz recognized Criss and Jon as part of the band who had impressed him so much at the high school show. Steve would eventually join a new version of Avatar, joined later by bass player Keith Collins, who originally knew the band as they hired his equipment. Jon felt restrained by playing instruments and subsequently stuck to being the band’s lead vocalist.</p><p align=justify>He was raised and born there in The Bronx, New York City, New York.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jon Oliva</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oliva</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Metal Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Criss Oliva</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jon Oliva ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Quickly, Atlantic Records were becoming interested in the band, and label reps flew in from New York to see the band perform. Atlantic quickly got Savatage signed to a deal, but Savatage finished out their deal with Par, releasing EP The Dungeons Are Calling in 1984. The band’s first release for Atlantic was unleashed in 1985, entitled Power of the Night, the album was produced by Max Norman, who had produced the legendary Ozzy Osbourne albums Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary of a Madman as well as producing Megadeth’s hit 1992 album, Countdown to Extinction among others. During this time, the band hired Johnny Lee Middleton to replace Keith Collins on bass duties due to musical differences.</p><h2>Jon Oliva Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jon Oliva is one of the <strong>richest Metal Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Jon Oliva</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>After playing in a range of groups, he was highlighted on Music Magazine. Tampa Bay music publication Music Magazine for his group Avatar.&nbsp;After being harassed by an European band about their name, the band changed the name to Savatage.</p><p align=justify>Alongside his musical work, the artist made the rock show he first created, Streets, in 1991.</p><p align=justify>John Nicholas “Jon” Oliva (born July 22, 1960) is an American composer, multi-instrumentalist and singer. He is best known as the co-founder, keyboardist and lead vocalist of the band Savatage, which he co-founded with his younger brother Criss Oliva. Since 1996 he has also been a songwriter, musician and vocalist in Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Producer Paul O’Neill, who had worked with many of the rock world’s biggest acts, referred to Oliva in numerous interviews as the single greatest vocalist/musician he has ever worked with.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Metal Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Savatage were finally getting exposure, but in 1986, the band released Fight for the Rock, a stab at mainstream success that was driven primarily by Atlantic. Jon himself refers to the record as Fight for the Nightmare. The material was written mostly by Jon and Criss in the kitchen of the apartment the band was staying in. Some of the songs were written in the studio, such as “Lady In Disguise.” Atlantic put a lot of pressure on the band to become a radio friendly band and this resulted in the two covers of Free’s “Wishing Well” and Badfinger’s “Day After Day”. Fans were confused by the sudden shift in sound the band took and sales did not meet expectations. Jon had however described the album as a good “musical and life experience”.</p><p>Jon then met Paul O’Neill, who saw that Savatage had the potential to be a big act. 1987’s Hall of the Mountain King was released to critical acclaim and is cited by many fans as being one of the band’s best works. Two music videos were released and received rotation on MTV, for “24 Hours Ago” and the title track. On the resulting tour, Savatage supported Megadeth and Dio, but Jon had many conflicts with Dave Mustaine, who at the time was a serious substance abuser. After hanging out with Mustaine on a 24-hour basis, after the tour, Jon entered rehab.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jon Oliva height</b> Not available right now.

This gave Jon his first touring experience as the band played bars and clubs in various parts of Florida, but Jon quickly grew tired of the bars and clubs, leaving the band later that year.</p><p align=justify>In 1991, the band created their first rock opera, Streets. The record did not do as well as the band would have liked, however, as it was released around the time that grunge exploded onto the mainstream music arena. But a video for “Jesus Saves” was recorded and again got airplay and got a new audience to appreciate the band. Jon has stated that his favorite song of all-time was recorded on Streets: Tonight He Grins Again. However, after a tour in support of the album, Jon Oliva left the band. The official reason given was to concentrate on his side-projects Doctor Butcher and his Broadway-bound musical Romanov as well as continuing co-writing Savatage material with his brother Criss and producer Paul O’Neill. Jon’s last show was at the first ever Tampa Music Awards in 1992 and in 2006, footage was released onto the internet of this last performance. However, as of 2007, Romanov is in the hands of the Pace Theatrical Group and has gone through several rewrites, but has yet to see the light of day.</p><h2>Who is Jon Oliva Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jon Oliva</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Many of the songs on the album Jon came up with while in rehab, including “Thorazine Shuffle” and “Mentally Yours”. The song “Gutter Ballet” was one of the last to be recorded, and was in fact recorded with just Jon and Criss in the studio. After seeing a performance of the Phantom of the Opera in Toronto, Jon was so inspired he wrote “Gutter Ballet” in the studio. Two videos were filmed for the album and again received MTV airplay: “When the Crowds are Gone” and the title track.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Jon Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Metal Singer</strong>.

Jon chose to continue the band, although he has since admitted that the band was pretty much over after Criss’s death, but only kept going because of his memory and to “keep his music alive”. Savatage’s 1994 album Handful of Rain is considered Jon Oliva’s tribute to his brother. He recorded the album along with Stevens and Alex Skolnick, formerly of Testament. Even though the other Savatage members are credited, Oliva plays the majority of the instruments.
