He was listed on Time magazine’s Time 100, an annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world, in 2008. Al-Waleed is a grandson of Ibn Saud, the first Saudi Arabian king, a nephew of all Saudi Arabian kings since, and a grandson of Riad Al Solh (Lebanon’s first prime minister).</p><p>Al-Waleed’s parents separated when he was seven, and he lived with his mother in Lebanon. He first attended Pinewood College in Beirut. As a boy, he ran away from home for a day or two at a time (sleeping in unlocked cars) before attending military school in Riyadh, the King Abdul Aziz Military Academy.

In 1983, owned by Khashoggi, it appeared as the Flying Saucer (the yacht of James Bond’s villain, Largo) in Never Say Never Again. It was sold to Donald Trump, who renamed her the Trump Princess.

His father was Saudi Arabia’s finance minister during the early 1960s, before he went into exile due to his advocacy for political reform.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Business Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Al-Waleed began his business career in 1979 after graduating from Menlo College. He returned to Saudi Arabia, which was in the midst of the 1974–85 oil boom. Operating from a small, four-room cabin in Riyadh and $30,000 start-up money provided by Prince Talal, al-Waleed formed Kingdom Establishment in 1980. When that money ran out in a few months, he secured a $300,000 loan from the Saudi American Bank, partly owned by Citibank. Rather than taking a commission for facilitating contracts as the legally required middleman, Al-Waleed insisted on a stake in the project. His first success was in 1982, partnering with a South Korean construction company, and from then on, his commissions were used to fund his real estate deals. In his own words, “All the money I used to get from this construction I would plough back into real estate, and in the stock market, both.”</p><p>After the end of the Saudi oil boom, Al-Waleed acquired the underperforming United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB). Through mergers with Saudi Cairo Bank (SCB), forming United Saudi Bank (USB), and the Saudi American Bank (SAMBA), it became a leading Middle Eastern bank. The hostile takeover of USCB in 1986, the merger with SCB in 1997, and the merger of USB with SAMBA in 1999, were the first of their kind in the Kingdom. He then secured a majority in Al-Azizia Panda, merging it with the Savola Group, and took over National Industrialization Company.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Al-Waleed bin Talal height</b> Not available right now.

His first marriage was in 1976, at the age of nineteen. His first wife was his cousin, Dalal bint Saud, a daughter of King Saud. They have two children (Prince Khaled, born on 21 April 1978 and Princess Reem, born on 20 June 1982), and later divorced, in Dec. 1994.</p><p align=justify>He has not earned enough income from his investments to pay for all that he has spent in the 1990s. The mystery goes back to that first stake in Citicorp. The prince has declared that this money came entirely from his personal funds. He says he started out in 1979 with a loan of just $30,000 from his father. He also mortgaged a house that his father had given him, raising something like $400,000. And each month, as a grandson of Ibn Saud, he receives $15,000. You could barely clothe a Saudi prince for such sums, let alone furnish him with a multi-billion-dollar empire. Nevertheless, by 1991 Prince Alwaleed had felt able to risk an investment of $797m in Citicorp.</p><h2>Who is Al-Waleed bin Talal Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Al-Waleed bin Talal</strong> married to <strong>Ameera Al-Taweel </strong>.

You may help us to build the dating records for Al-Waleed bin Talal!<p>By 1989, his net worth was $1.4 billion, and included stakes in Canary Wharf, Four Seasons Hotel Group, and News Corporation. When Al-Waleed turned to the international market, he focused on “established brands going through hard times,” as Riz Khan puts it. Al-Waleed would do his homework, and then wait for the proper purchase entry point. He invested about $250 million in Chase Manhattan, Citigroup, Manufacturers Hanover, and Chemical Bank. After seven months, he sold his stakes in the other banks and concentrated on investing in Citicorp, acquiring 4.9 percent of the bank. Though the worst performing bank of the four, Al-Waleed considered Citicorp had the best potential.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Al-Waleed Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Business Executive</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in Saudi Arabia</strong>. Al-Waleed bin Talal celebrates birthday on March 7 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In Sept. 1990, Citibank was undercapitalized due to real estate credit losses and exposure to Latin America debt, prompting a need for a capital reserve. By Nov. they were actively seeking investors. Based on his banking experience in the Kingdom, Al-Waleed agreed in Jan. 1991 to invest $590 million, about half his accumulated wealth, in a five-year convertible security paying 11 percent interest. By Feb., that took his total investment in Citicorp to $797 million, or about 15 percent of the company. Though he had received a Federal Reserve temporary waiver to own such a large portion of the company, Al-Waleed sold enough shares in 1993 to get below the 10 percent threshold. Still, he was the largest shareholder in the largest US financial institution at the time. Yet, in Alwaleed’s words, “It is not a relationship, it’s an alliance. We are there forever with them.” Sandy Weill says of Al-Waleed, “I think what he did really saved the bank.”</p><h3>Who is the richest Saudi prince?</h3><p><b>Alwaleed bin Talal</b> is a billionaire and member of the Saudi Arabian royal family.
