This album included the singles “Hang Tight” and his signature hit “Risin’ to the Top,” a big success in Chicago. The latter song has become a popular sampling choice for hip hop artists, having been borrowed by artists such as Doug E Fresh (“Keep Risin To The Top”), Big Daddy Kane (“Smooth Operator”), LL Cool J (“Around the Way Girl”), Pete Rock & CL Smooth (“Take You There”), Mary J. Blige (“Love No Limit”), O.C. (“Born 2 Live”), and Sean Price (“Sabado Gigante”), though a lot of these songs have been mistakenly thought to use the bass line from the 1983 song “All Night Long” by the Mary Jane Girls. In 2006, “Rising to The Top” appeared in the soundtrack for the popular video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, on fictional Quiet Storm station Vice City For Lovers.</p><h2>Who is Keni Burke Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Keni Burke</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
