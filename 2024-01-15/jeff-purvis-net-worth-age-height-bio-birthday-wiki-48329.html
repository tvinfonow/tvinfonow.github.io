Jeffery “Jeff” Purvis (born February 19, 1959) is a former race car driver in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. He is a 15-year veteran with four wins and 25 top-five finishes. He suffered a massive brain injury after a 2002 crash and has not run a NASCAR-sanctioned race since 2004. He currently races crate late models at Golden Isles Speedway.</p><p>Purvis would run six races for Finch in 1991. His best start of that year was 22nd. He set his career best finish to that date at Atlanta. After starting 29th, Purvis completed many laps and finished in the 24th position. He only finished two races that season.</p><p>Purvis ran two races in 1993, both with Morgan-McClure Motorsports, who he was also racing with in the Cup Series. He qualified in 11th and 7th the two races, the seventh at Atlanta being his career best. In 1994, Country Time Lemonade sponsored Finch and Purvis in the Busch Series in a four-race deal. At Talladega Superspeedway, Purvis and Finch collected their first career Busch Pole Award. Purvis ran up front all day, and finished in fifth position. However, that was the only race he finished, with his next best finish in 1994 being a 29th. However, he qualified fourth at Bristol and ninth at Richmond.</p><p>In 1993, Purvis ran the most races in a season for his career. Making eight starts, Purvis ran three races for Finch and five races for Morgan-McClure Motorsports in their No. 4 Eastman Kodak Chevy. At Talladega in July, Purvis was able to top his previous best start with a 21st, as well as enjoying the best runs of his career. He earned his best qualifying effort of 18th at Richmond and quickly followed it up with his career-best 16th-place finish. The next week, he broke his best finish again with a 13th-place finish at Dover and also added a 17th at Martinsville.</p><p align=justify>Purvis made his NASCAR debut in 1990. He was hired to drive Bobby Allison’s No. 12 Raybestos Buick at Martinsville Speedway. He started in 31st position for that race, but crashed out and finished 28th. After that, Purvis raced four more times in 1990 in the No. 51 Plasti-Kote Chevrolet owned by James Finch, who once owned his cars when he raced late model dirt races. His best finish among those was a 31st at North Wilkesboro. He also set his best start of 1990 there, 24th.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff Purvis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yang</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Clarksville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tennessee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jeff Purvis ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
