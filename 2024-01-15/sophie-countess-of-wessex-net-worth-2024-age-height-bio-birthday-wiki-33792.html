She met Prince Edward again at a charity event in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards. Their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999. Edward proposed to Sophie with an engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat white gold. The ring was made by Asprey and Garrard (now Garrard & Co) and is worth an estimated £105,000. Sophie, who was reportedly close to the Queen from the beginning of her relationship with Edward, was allowed to use the royal apartments at Buckingham Palace prior to her engagement. The wedding took place on 19 June of the same year at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, a break from the weddings of Edward’s older siblings, which were large, formal events at Westminster Abbey or St Paul’s Cathedral. On the day of their marriage, Prince Edward was created a hereditary peer as Earl of Wessex with the subsidiary title of Viscount Severn (derived from the Welsh roots of the Countess’s family). It is understood that he will be elevated as Duke of Edinburgh when that title reverts to the Crown. The couple spent their honeymoon at Balmoral Castle. Following their union, the Earl and Countess moved to Bagshot Park, their home in Surrey. While their private residence is Bagshot Park, their office and official London residence is based at Buckingham Palace. Due to renovations at Buckingham Palace in 2018, the couple temporarily moved their offices to St James’s Palace.</p><p>The Countess of Wessex’s first overseas tour after her marriage was to the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island in 2000.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sophie, Countess of Wessex height</b> <strong>5 ft 5 im</strong> Sophie, <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 5 im</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In May 1999, less than a month before her wedding, The Sun published a photo of a topless Sophie with her Capital Radio colleague Chris Tarrant, which was taken during a business trip to Spain in 1988. Buckingham Palace immediately issued a statement saying, “This morning’s story in The Sun is a gross invasion of privacy and cannot be regarded as in the public interest. It has caused considerable distress.” Prime Minister Tony Blair also condemned the publication of the photograph. The Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). According to Sophie’s business partner the incident had left her “distressed”, and she was reportedly “devastated” and felt “she was ‘letting the side down’ before her wedding”. Tarrant later said, “There was never, ever the slightest hint of romance between Sophie and myself, let alone these snidey insinuations.” Following its publication, the newspaper issued a statement and apologised to Rhys-Jones and the next issue came out with the headline “Sorry, Sophie”. It also said that it would again apologise to Sophie in a letter and donate all sale proceeds of the issue to her charities. The photo was sold to the tabloid by Kara Noble, a former friend and colleague of Sophie. Noble later apologised in the following months saying, “I just want to say sorry to everyone who was involved.” Both she and the newspaper faced criticism from the public, and Noble was fired from her job at Heart 106.2 FM. The couple later decided not to make a formal complaint.</p><p align=justify>Buckingham Palace denied the accuracy of the reports, saying: “The Countess of Wessex, who is trying to pursue her own career, is obviously vulnerable to set-ups such as this.” The Palace released a statement saying the reported comments were “selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue”. The Palace officials stated that the Countess had not insulted the Queen, the Queen Mother, or the politicians, and the rumours about her difficulties in marriage and her alleged comments about her husband’s sexuality were untrue, while according to the Mail on Sunday multiple reliable sources had confirmed these reports. Subsequently, in 2002, both the Earl and Countess announced that they would quit their business interests in order to focus on activities and official engagements on behalf of the royal family and aid the Queen in her Golden Jubilee year.</p><h2>Who is Sophie, Countess of Wessex Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sophie, Countess of Wessex</strong> married to <strong>Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex </strong>.
