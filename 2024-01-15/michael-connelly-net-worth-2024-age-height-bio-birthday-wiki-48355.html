He is a best-selling author who created the characters Harry Bosch, LAPD detective, and Mickey Haller, criminal defense lawyer.&nbsp;His many mystery novels, including The Black Box and The Lincoln Lawyer, have been awarded.</p><p>Connelly’s book The Concrete Blonde was used to photograph American President&nbsp;American President <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a> was photographed with Connelly’s book The Concrete Blonde..</p><p>Michael Joseph Connelly (born July 21, 1956) is an American author of detective novels and other crime fiction, notably those featuring LAPD Detective Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch and criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller. Connelly is the bestselling author of 31 novels and one work of non-fiction, with over 60 million copies of his books sold worldwide and translated into 40 foreign languages. His first novel, The Black Echo, won the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for Best First Novel in 1992. In 2002, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in the movie adaptation of Connelly’s 1998 novel, Blood Work. In March 2011, the movie adaptation of Connelly’s novel The Lincoln Lawyer starred Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller. Connelly was the President of the Mystery Writers of America from 2003 to 2004.</p><p>Connelly had planned on following his father’s early choice of career in building construction and started out at the University of Florida in Gainesville, at the Rinker School of Building Construction, studying construction management. After earning grades that were lower than expected, Connelly went to see Robert Altman’s film The Long Goodbye (1973). The film, based on Raymond Chandler’s eponymous 1953 novel, inspired Connelly to want to become a mystery writer. Connelly went home and read all of Chandler’s works featuring Philip Marlowe, and decided to transfer to the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, major in journalism, and minor in creative writing.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Pennsylvania and Florida.&nbsp;He married Linda McCaleb in April 1984.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael Connelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Connelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Philadelphia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mary Connelly, W.

Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Michael Connelly's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Michael Connelly's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>When starting a book, he says, the story is not always clear, but Connelly has “a hunch” as to where it is going. The books often reference real-world events, such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the September 11 attacks. Events that might seem of minor significance are included in some of the books, because of Connelly’s personal interest in them. For example, City of Bones, in which Detective Bosch investigates the murder of an 11-year-old boy, was written during Connelly’s early years as a father of a daughter, and it hit close to home. According to Connelly, he didn’t mean to write about the biggest fear of his life; it just came out that way.</p><h2>Michael Connelly Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Michael Connelly is one of the <strong>richest Novelist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Michael Connelly</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>At sixteen years old, he saw a man throwing a gun in the bushes next to his house. This sparked his interest in mystery novels and crime.&nbsp;He graduated from the University of Florida in 1981 and became a crime reporter for the Daytona Beach News Journal.</p><p align=justify>From 2003 to 2004, he was President of the Mystery Writers of America.</p><p align=justify>After moving to Los Angeles, Connelly went to see the High Tower Apartments where Raymond Chandler’s character Philip Marlowe had lived (in The High Window (1942)), and Robert Altman had used for his film The Long Goodbye (1973). Connelly got the manager of the building to promise to phone him if the apartment ever became available. Ten years later, the manager tracked Connelly down, and Connelly decided to rent the place. This apartment served as a place to write for several years.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After three years at the Los Angeles Times, Connelly wrote his first published novel, The Black Echo (1992), after previously writing two unfinished novels that he had not attempted to get published. He sold The Black Echo to Little, Brown to be published in 1992 and won the Mystery Writers of America’s Edgar Award for best first novel. The book is partly based on a true crime and is the first one featuring Connelly’s primary recurring character, Los Angeles Police Department Detective Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch, a man who, according to Connelly, shares few similarities with the author himself. Connelly named Bosch after the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, known for his paintings full of sin and redemption, such as the painting Hell, a copy of which hangs on the office wall behind Connelly’s computer. Connelly describes his own work as a big canvas with all the characters of his books floating across it as currents on a painting. Sometimes they are bound to collide, creating cross currents. This is something that Connelly creates by bringing back characters from previous books and letting them play a part in books written five or six years after first being introduced.</p><p>Harry Bosch and Connelly received a good deal of publicity in 1994, when President Bill Clinton came out of a bookstore carrying a copy of The Concrete Blonde in front of the waiting cameras. A meeting was set up between the two at Los Angeles International Airport.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Connelly height</b> Not available right now.

There, he covered the crime beat during the South Florida cocaine wars. He stayed with the paper for a few years and in 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of the 1985 Delta Flight 191 plane crash, which story earned Connelly a place as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. The honor also brought Connelly a job as a crime reporter at the Los Angeles Times. He moved to California in 1987 with his wife Linda McCaleb, whom he met while in college and married in April 1984.</p><p align=justify>Connelly wrote another book featuring Bosch, Angels Flight (1999), before writing Void Moon (2000), a free-standing book about Las Vegas thief Cassie Black. In 2001, A Darkness More Than Night was published, in which Connelly united Bosch and McCaleb to solve a crime together, before releasing two books in 2002. The first, City of Bones, was the eighth Bosch novel, and the other, Chasing the Dime, was a non-series novel. In 2001, Connelly left California for Tampa Bay, Florida, together with his wife and daughter, so that both he and his wife could be closer to their families. His novels still took place in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Who is Michael Connelly Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Michael Connelly</strong> married to <strong>Linda McCaleb </strong>.

The book was a success. In 1997, Connelly returned to Bosch in Trunk Music before writing another book, Blood Work (1998), about a different character, FBI agent Terry McCaleb. Blood Work was made into a film in 2002, directed by Clint Eastwood, who also played McCaleb, an agent with a transplanted heart, in pursuit of his donor’s murderer. The book came together after one of Connelly’s friends had a heart transplant, and he saw what his friend was going through with survivor’s guilt after the surgery. When asked if he had anything against the changes made to fit the big screen, Connelly simply replied: “If you take their money, it’s their turn to tell the story”.</p><h2>Top Facts about Michael Connelly</h2><p>1.
