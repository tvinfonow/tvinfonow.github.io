Lead singer of the experimental post-hardcore bands Circa Survive and Saosin, as well as a solo artist.</p><p>He and <a href=#>Craig Owens</a> have collaborated.</p><p>Anthony Green’s first band formed in 1997 while he was in high school with classmate and musician Tommy Dougherty (Junction 232). The band originally had Dougherty on guitar and Green on bass and vocals. Eventually, they recruited drummer Evan Madden. Green wanted to name the band ‘Saosin’, but Dougherty and Madden decided against it. Before settling on the “Audience of One” name, they played a few shows under the name “Handsome Pete” in 1998 and one show under the name “The Bill Bixby Experience”. Due to problems with Evan’s availability to practice and play shows, they sought out a new drummer.</p><p>Green and Dougherty switched bass and guitar duties. Green met drummer J.D. Foster (Makeshift/Yellow 5) at Days Away’s first show in summer of 1998. Foster tried out and musically they clicked right away. The band recorded an LP entitled, I Remember When This All Meant Something at Skylight Studio in the summer of 1999. It was released on Break Even Records on December 3, 1999.</p><p align=justify>He married Meredith Green.

Chris Warner filled in on drums during early rehearsals. Kennedy quit the band due to personal reasons. Chris Sorenson took the spot as bassist.

Green and Zolof parted ways in early 2002 due to Green’s need to “work some things out” in his personal life. They still remain good friends. One year later, Ratti and Minton helped Anthony record vocals over the Saosin instrumental demo recordings, then known as ‘The Gift’. Two years later, Green contributed vocals to the Zolof The Rock & Roll Destroyer song “This Was All A Bad Idea” off of their album The Popsicle EP [2004].

The physical compact disc of the remix album wasn’t available until around January 20, 2009 when the vinyl bundles shipped.</p><h3>When did Anthony Green leave Saosin?</h3><p>In <b>February 2004</b>, the band’s vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin and later formed the band Circa Survive.
