Who is Ronald Defeo Jr. dating now & how much money does Ronald Defeo Jr. have?</p><h2>Ronald Defeo Jr. Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Ronald Defeo Jr.</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Criminal</strong> who was born on <strong>September 26, 1951</strong> in Brooklyn, New York, <strong>United States</strong>. Mass murderer who killed his mother, father and four siblings as they were sleeping. He was the inspiration for The Amityville Horror.</p><p>Actor <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> starred in the 2005 film The Amityville Horror, based on the book about the killings., actor, was a star in 2005’s The Amityville Horror. Based on the book about the killings,</p><p>The victims were Ronald Jr.’s parents: Ronald DeFeo Sr. (44) and Louise DeFeo, née Brigante (42); and his four siblings: Dawn (18), Allison (13), Marc (12), and John Matthew (9). All of the victims had been shot with a .35 caliber lever action Marlin 336C rifle around three o’clock in the morning of that day. The DeFeo parents had both been shot twice, while the children had all been killed with single shots. Physical evidence suggests that Louise DeFeo and her daughter Allison were both awake at the time of their deaths. According to Suffolk County Police, the victims were all found lying face down in bed. The DeFeo family had occupied 112 Ocean Avenue since purchasing it in 1965. The six victims were later buried in nearby Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale.</p><p>Judge Stark denied the motion, writing, “I find the testimony of the defendant overall to be false and fabricated. His testimony that during the fall of 1974 he was married and lived with his wife and child at Long Branch, New Jersey is incredible and not worthy of belief. He produced no corroborating evidence in this regard… another reason for my disbelief of defendant’s testimony is demonstrated by consideration of several portions of the trial testimony… he signed a lengthy written statement describing in detail his activities… in this statement he said that he lived with his family at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville and that he worked for his father… that he usually went to and from work with his father; that he was ill and stayed home from work on November 12, 1974; that he was on probation for having stolen an outboard engine and had an appointment to see his probation officer in Amityville on that very afternoon… defendant’s girlfriend, Mindy Weiss, testified that she began dating the defendant in June 1974, and was with him frequently that summer and fall”. Stark further declared, “Defendant’s testimony that he did not shoot and kill the members of his family is likewise incredible and not worthy of belief”.</p><p align=justify>He was the son Ronald DeFeo Sr. and Louise DeFeo.&nbsp;He claimed that he heard his family plotting against himself and so he killed them all in his sleep.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ronald Defeo Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ronald</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dawn DeFeo, John Matthew DeFeo, Allison DeFeo, Marc DeFeo</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Nissa Burkhalter (m. 2012–2015), Barbara Puco (m. 1994–1999), Geraldine Gates (m. 1989–1993)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ronald Defeo Jr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He and his defense lawyer, William Weber, mounted an affirmative defense of insanity, with DeFeo claiming that he killed his family in self-defense because he heard their voices plotting against him. The insanity plea was supported by the psychiatrist for the defense, Daniel Schwartz. The psychiatrist for the prosecution, Dr. Harold Zolan, maintained that, although DeFeo was a user of heroin and LSD, he had antisocial personality disorder and was aware of his actions at the time of the crime.</p><p>Most of the claims made in Ric Osuna’s book are sourced to Ronald DeFeo Jr.’s ex-wife, Geraldine Gates. While in the 1986 interview with Newsday she asserted she married DeFeo in 1974, in Osuna’s book, she alleges they married in 1970.

I think my mother and father are shot!” DeFeo and a small group of people went to 112 Ocean Avenue, which was located near the bar, and found that DeFeo’s parents were dead inside the house. One of the group, DeFeo’s friend Joe Yeswit, made an emergency call to the Suffolk County Police, who searched the house and found that six members of the same family were dead in their beds.</p><p align=justify>In 1990, Ronald DeFeo Jr. filed a 440 motion, a proceeding to have his conviction vacated. In support of his motion, DeFeo asserted that Dawn and an unknown assailant, who fled the house before he could get a good look at him, killed their parents and Dawn subsequently killed their siblings. He said the only person he killed was Dawn and that it was by accident as they struggled over the rifle. Again, he asserted he was married to Geraldine and that her brother was with him at the time of the murders. An affidavit from Richard Romondoe was submitted to the court and it was asserted he could not be located to testify in person. Evidence was submitted to the court by the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office suggesting that Richard Romondoe did not exist and that Geraldine Gates was living in upstate New York married to someone else at the time of the murders. Geraldine Gates did not testify at this hearing because the authorities had already confronted her about the false claims and in 1992 secured a statement under oath where she admitted Romondoe was fictitious and that she did not actually marry DeFeo until 1989 in anticipation of the filing of the 440 motion.</p><h2>Who is Ronald Defeo Jr. Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ronald Defeo Jr.</strong> married to <strong>Nissa Burkhalter (m. 2012–2015), Barbara Puco (m. 1994–1999), Geraldine Gates (m. 1989–1993)</strong>.

You may help us to build the dating records for Ronald Defeo Jr.!<p>Since his conviction, DeFeo has given several varying accounts of how the killings were carried out. In a 1986 interview for Newsday, DeFeo claimed his sister Dawn killed their father and then their distraught mother killed all of his siblings before he killed his mother. He stated that he took the blame because he was afraid to say anything negative about his mother to her father, Michael Brigante Sr., and his father’s uncle, out of fear that they would kill him. His father’s uncle was Pete DeFeo, a caporegime in the Genovese crime family. In this interview, DeFeo also asserted he was married at the time of the murders to a woman named Geraldine Gates, with whom he was living in New Jersey, and that his mother phoned to ask him to return to Amityville to break up a fight between Dawn and their father. Subsequently, he drove to Amityville with Geraldine’s brother, Richard Romondoe, who was with him at the time of the murders and could verify his story completely.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ronald Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Criminal</strong>.
