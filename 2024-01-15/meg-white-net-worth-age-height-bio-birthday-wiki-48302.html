Her music career began when, on a whim, she played on Jack White’s drums in 1997. Jack was deeply inspired by her minimalist and un-schooled drumming style. The two decided to form a band and began performing two months later. The duo named themselves The White Stripes because of their last name and Meg’s fondness for peppermint candy. The band quickly became a Detroit underground favorite before reaching national, then international fame. White has been nominated for various awards as a part of the White Stripes, and has received four Grammy Awards.</p><p>White was married to Jack White from September 21, 1996 to March 24, 2000.

They began their career as part of Michigan’s underground, garage rock music scene. They played along with and opened for more established local bands such as Bantam Rooster, the Dirtbombs, Two Star Tabernacle, Rocket 455, and the Hentchmen, among others. In 1998, the band signed with Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label of Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classic, De Stijl. The album eventually peaked at number 38 in Billboard’s Independent Albums chart. Even as their success as a band was mounting, their personal relationship was faltering, and they were divorced in 2000.</p><h2>Meg White Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Meg White is one of the <strong>richest Drummer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Meg White</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>After growing up in Detroit, she worked as a bartender.</p><p align=justify>She was greatly influenced by&nbsp;She was influenced by <a href=#>Bob Dylan</a>..</p><p align=justify>White was born in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan on December 10, 1974, to Walter Hackett White, Jr. and Catherine White. She grew up in the affluent Detroit suburb with her parents and older sister, Heather. She attended Grosse Pointe North High School and, according to one classmate, was “always the quiet, obviously artistic type, and she just kept very much to herself.” While still in high school, she decided not to go to college and instead pursue a career as a chef. Meg began to work at Memphis Smoke, a restaurant in downtown Royal Oak. It was there that she first met budding musician John “Jack” Gillis, a fellow high school senior from a Detroit neighborhood known as Mexicantown, and they frequented the coffee shops, local music venues, and record stores of the area. They began dating and were eventually married on September 21, 1996. Gillis took her last name.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>White calls herself “very shy”, and has kept a low public profile. Meg and Jack White publicly portrayed themselves as siblings. However, public records emerged in 2001 that showed Meg and Jack were not related; in fact they had married in 1996 prior to the band’s formation. They divorced in 2000, before The White Stripes ascended to international fame. In 2009, she married guitarist Jackson Smith, son of musicians Patti Smith and Fred “Sonic” Smith. They divorced in 2013.</p><p>As the White Stripes’ fame spread beyond Detroit, the unconventional band with no bass player and a novice drummer became the subject of mixed commentary among critics and fans. Of a 2002 concert in Cleveland, Ohio, Chuck Klosterman said, “[Meg] never grimaced and didn’t appear to sweat; yet somehow her drums sounded like a herd of Clydesdales falling out of the sky, one after another. Clearly this is a band at the apex of its power.” UK periodical, The Times said that she “reduced the art of drumming to its primary components, bashing the snare and cymbal together on alternating beats with the bass drum in a way that recalled Moe Tucker of the Velvet Underground.” An NPR article gave high praise, saying “On the drums, Meg White smashed out carnal, visceral, raw, sometimes funny and always urgent stories that told of the human experience. Maybe that’s the thumping feeling that penetrates our pores and anchors our attention when we listen to The White Stripes. Maybe that’s why we ever cared about the band in the first place.” On the other hand, the Associated Press called her playing “maddeningly rudimentary.” The satirical news site The Onion once featured the headline “Meg White Drum Solo Maintains Steady Beat For 23 Minutes”. In reference to her “primal” approach to drumming, she remarked, “That is my strength. A lot of drummers would feel weird about being that simplistic.” Jack has stated Meg’s drumming to be the “best part of this band,” and called her a “strong female presence in rock and roll.” He called her detractors “sexist”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Meg White height</b> <strong>5 ft 6 in</strong> Meg <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to the bands mythos, on Bastille Day (July 14) of 1997, Meg tried playing Jack’s drumkit on a whim. In Jack’s words, “When she started to play drums with me, just on a lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. There was something in it that opened me up.” The two then began calling themselves The White Stripes (because Meg favored peppermint candies) and soon played their first gig at the Gold Dollar in Detroit. Their live performances were made of three basic elements, Jack did the guitar and vocal work while she played drums.</p><p align=justify>White began with a red Ludwig Classic Maple kit that had a red and white peppermint swirl on the resonant heads of the toms and bass drum. On the Icky Thump tour, the bass drum head design was switched to a button. While recording From the Basement: The White Stripes, the design was switched to an image of White’s hand holding the apple from the Get Behind Me Satan cover. Beginning in 2006, she also used a pair of Paiste 14″ Signature Medium Hi-Hats, a 19″ Signature Power Crash, and a 22″ 2002 Ride. Meg also used Remo and Ludwig drumheads, various percussion instruments and Vater drumsticks.</p><h2>Who is Meg White Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Meg White</strong> married to <strong>Jackson Smith , Jack White </strong>.
