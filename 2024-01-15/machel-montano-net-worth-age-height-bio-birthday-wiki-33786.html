Since 2007 they have been known as Machel Montano HD (High Definition); Montano promotes the concept by saying that he is the first human being to go HD.

He is part of a campaign in Trinidad and Tobago to promote safe driving – “Arrive Alive”.

After its debut in 2007, the bus was re-painted for 2008, the new images of Machel matching various photos from the album artwork of his 2008 CD, Flame On. The bus featured heavily in his videos for “Jumbie” (2007) and “Rollin/Blazin d Trail” (2008).

He won the Groovy Soca Monarch with his rendition of “Mr. Fete”. In May 2012 he launched the music video to his hit single “Bottle Of Rum”.
