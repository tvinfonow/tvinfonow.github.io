Nicknamed The Beast, he is a WBC Welterweight Champion, IBF Welterweight Champion, and two-time National Golden Gloves champion.</p><p>His time as champion came to an end at the hands of <a href=#>Victor Ortiz</a> in April 2011.</p><p>On February 13, 2017, it was announced that a deal was close to being made between Berto and former welterweight world champion Shawn Porter (26-2-1, 16 KOs). On March 5, it was officially confirmed the fight would take place on April 22, 2017, at the Barclays Center in New York City with CBS confirming Showtime would televise the bout. Halfway through the press conference, promoter Lou DiBella confessed that he received a phone call from WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman and he reported the fight would be a final eliminator. On March 4, Keith Thurman defeated Danny Garcia to become the new WBA and WBC unified welterweight champion.</p><p>ESPN’s Dan Rafael announced on April 28, 2018, that a deal had been reached for Berto to fight former 2-weight world champion Devon Alexander (27-4-1, 14 KOs) on the Errol Spence Jr. vs. Carlos Ocampo undercard on June 16 at The Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas, however the fight did not take place. On June 25, the fight was slated to take place on the Mikey Garcia vs. Robert Easter Jr. lightweight unification card at the Staples Center on July 28 on Showtime. The fight would instead main event its own card on August 4 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York on Fox. Berto was dropped earlier on but rallied on in the second half of the fight to win a controversial split decision. One judge scored the bout 114–113 for Alexander, but the remaining two judges overruled, both scoring 115–112 in favor of Berto, giving him the win. Alexander had the better workrate of the two in the opening rounds and dropped Berto in round 3 after catching him with a left hand to the head. Replays showed the two shots landed on the back of Berto’s head. The knockdown stood because Berto had rotated his head before the punches landed. Alexander began to tire around midway and Berto started taking over. In round 7, after trading on the inside, Berto suffered a cut near his right eye. Berto was at his best in round 12 using both hands. Alexander fought back and both boxers traded close as the fight came to an end. Websites, Boxing Scene and BadLeftHook had Alexander the winner and felt although Berto caught up in the later rounds, he did not do enough to win the fight. Alexander thought the fight was close, but should have taken the decision. Berto stated he was not interested in a rematch as he was at the point in his career where he only wanted paydays. The fight averaged 1,193,000 viewers and peaked at 1,266,000 viewers.</p><p align=justify>His brother, James Edson Berto, is a professional mixed martial artist.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andre Berto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andre</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Berto</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Winter Haven</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dieuseul Berto, Wilnise Berto</strong></td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cleveland Berto, James Edson Berto, Naomi Berto, Revelina Berto, Rachelle Berto</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Andre Berto ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Those dreams were dashed in the opening round of the trials, when he was disqualified for throwing Juan McPherson to the canvas. Berto was winning the fight, before McPherson bumped into him before being pushed to the canvas, and was deemed in no condition to continue. The act was ruled a flagrant foul, and Berto was disqualified. A protest was ruled in his favor, as he was declared the winner and advanced to the next round. Berto won that bout as well and prepared for the finals before a follow-up meeting the night before reverted to the initial ruling, eliminating Berto from the tournament. Because his parents emigrated from Haiti, Berto was able to keep his Olympic hopes alive, qualifying for Team Haiti, and subsequently granted Haitian citizenship alongside his American nationality, an exception the island country awarded the Olympian. Berto lost in the first-round to Xavier Noel of France.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Andre Berto height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Andre <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On April 16, 2011, Berto’s reign as WBC welterweight champion came to an abrupt end in a fight which proved to be one of the biggest upsets of 2011 at the hands of a moving up in weight form 140 “Vicious” Victor Ortíz.
