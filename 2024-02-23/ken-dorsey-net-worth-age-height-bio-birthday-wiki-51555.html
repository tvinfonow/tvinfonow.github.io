Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Despite a strong college career, Dorsey was selected in the seventh round with the 241st overall pick of the 2003 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, due in part to concerns over Dorsey’s arm strength. In his first two seasons in the NFL, he played in nine games (starting in seven), completing 171 of his 316 pass attempts, and throwing for 1,712 yards and eight touchdowns with eleven interceptions. He started the 2005 season as the third quarterback behind Tim Rattay and #1 pick Alex Smith, moving into the backup role after the trade of Rattay to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He went on to start three games for the injured Alex Smith. In a Week 11 game against the Seattle Seahawks, Dorsey led an inspired comeback and was a two-point conversion away from sending the game into overtime.</p><h2>Ken Dorsey Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ken Dorsey is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ken Dorsey</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He had an illustrious career at the University of Miami, where he was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy twice.</p><p align=justify>Following his NFL career, he played in the CFL, and worked as a coach and executive in the NFL.</p><p align=justify>Kenneth Simon Dorsey (born April 22, 1981) is a former American football quarterback. He is currently the quarterbacks coach for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). Dorsey played college football for the University of Miami, where he was a two-time Heisman Trophy finalist. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2003 NFL Draft, and played for the Cleveland Browns from 2006 to 2008. He was then the quarterbacks coach for the Carolina Panthers from 2013 to 2017.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In May 2006, Dorsey was traded to the Cleveland Browns along with a 7th round pick in the 2007 NFL Draft for veteran quarterback Trent Dilfer, after having just re-signed with the 49ers. During training camp, Dorsey and Derek Anderson competed for the 2nd string position behind starter Charlie Frye. In the battle which ended in a virtual tie, Dorsey went on to serve as the third-string quarterback behind Anderson for all of the 2006 season. Dorsey was named the starter for the week 17 game against the Houston Texans but the previously injured Charlie Frye replaced him just minutes before the game. The Browns went on to lose to the Texans as Frye threw an interception and no touchdown passes.</p><p>Dorsey’s hopes of becoming a starter for the Cleveland Browns became much more bleak after the Browns drafted quarterback Brady Quinn of the University of Notre Dame with the 22nd overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. Charlie Frye, Derek Anderson, Quinn, and Dorsey battled for position on the Browns’ QB depth chart throughout the 2007 NFL Pre-season. On September 1, 2007, the Browns released Dorsey. After a disappointing loss to Pittsburgh in Week 1, Frye was traded to Seattle and Dorsey was re-signed by the Browns in a reserve role. Derek Anderson had a break-through season in 2007, further diminishing the chances of Dorsey receiving playing time.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ken Dorsey height</b> <strong>6 feet 4 inches</strong> Ken <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 4 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In addition, Dorsey was named the co-MVP of the 2002 Rose Bowl (in which Miami defeated the University of Nebraska to win its fifth national championship), Offensive Player of the Year twice (2001, 2002), and First-team All-Big East three times (2000, 2001, 2002).
