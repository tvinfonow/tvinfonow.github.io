Sometime after midnight, July 27, 1996, Eric Robert Rudolph, a terrorist who would later bomb a lesbian nightclub and two abortion clinics, planted a green backpack containing a fragmentation-laden pipe bomb under a bench. Jewell was working as a security guard for the event. He discovered the bag and alerted Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers. This discovery was nine minutes before Rudolph called 9-1-1 to deliver a warning. During a Jack Mack and the Heart Attack performance, Jewell and other security guards began clearing the immediate area so that a bomb squad could investigate the suspicious package. The bomb exploded 13 minutes later, killing Alice Hawthorne and injuring over one hundred others. A cameraman also died of a heart attack while running to cover the incident.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richard Jewell</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Markus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reiter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Security Guard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Danville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bobi Jewell, Robert Earl White</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dana Jewell</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Richard Jewell ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
