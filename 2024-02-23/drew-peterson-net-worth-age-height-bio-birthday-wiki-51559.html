Former police sergeant who was sentenced to 38 years in prison for the premeditated murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. In 2015, he was charged with solicitation of murder for attempting to have attorney James Glasgow killed.</p><p>He was portrayed by actor <a href=#>Rob Lowe</a> in the 2012 Lifetime movie Drew Peterson: Untouchable.</p><p>Peterson married accountant Kathleen Savio (born June 13, 1963 in Glendale Heights, Illinois) on May 3, 1992. Together they had two sons, Thomas (January 5, 1993) and Kristopher (August 8, 1994). Their divorce was finalized on October 10, 2003. It was reported that between 2002 and 2004, police were called out to the Peterson house eighteen times on domestic disturbance calls, including calls for returning children late after visitation. On March 1, 2004, Savio’s body was found in a waterless bathtub. Her death was initially ruled an accidental drowning by a coroner’s jury that included a police officer who personally knew Peterson and assured the other jurors that he was a good man who would never hurt his wife.</p><p>Drew Peterson graduated in 1972 from Willowbrook High School in Villa Park, Illinois, where he ran cross country. He joined the U.S. Army after graduation and briefly attended the College of DuPage in 1974 before moving to Falls Church, Virginia to train as a military police officer. Peterson began his 30-year career with the local police force in Bolingbrook, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago) in 1977. In 1978, he was assigned to the Metropolitan Area Narcotics Squad, and in 1979, he received a “Police Officer of the Year” award from the department. Peterson retired in November 2007 at age 53 with the rank of sergeant and was given a (tax-free) $79,000-a-year pension (almost $6,600-a-month). His pension was terminated following his second conviction in May 2016.</p><p align=justify>He was married a total of four times and had four children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drew Peterson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drew</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peterson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Betty Morphey, Donald Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Thomas Morphey</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Stacy Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lacy Peterson, Christopher Peterson, Thomas Peterson, Anthony Peterson</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Drew Peterson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Together they had two children, Anthony (born 2003) and Lacy (born 2005). Stacy legally adopted Savio’s children, and treated them like they were her own. She was close to completing her nursing degree from Joliet Junior College at the time of her disappearance on Sunday, October 28, 2007. Stacy was officially reported missing in the early hours of Monday, October 29, after her sister, Cassandra Cales, failed to hear from her when expected.

Postmortem photos showed extensive bruising and scraping to her back, torso, and face, as well as a large, unexplained gash in her scalp. The results of the official autopsy ordered by the county have yet to be released to the public. Will County State’s Attorney James Glasgow told the press that, after examining evidence in the case, he believed that the death was a “homicide staged to look like an accident”.
