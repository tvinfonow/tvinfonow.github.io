Woods net worth, age, height, bio, birthday, wiki, and salary!</strong> In this article, we will discover how old is D. Woods? Who is D. Woods dating now & how much money does D. Woods have?</p><h2>D. Woods Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>D. Woods</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer</strong> who was born on <strong>July 6, 1983</strong> in Anaheim, California, <strong>United States</strong>. Wanita Denise Woodgett (born July 6, 1985), better known as by her nickname D. Woods, is an American singer, dancer, and actress. Woods is the founder and CEO of Woodgrane Entertainment, but best known for her efforts on MTV’s “Making The Band 3” as a finalist on season two.</p><p>Woods has had two photo spreads with King Magazine. She is currently recording songs for a possible solo album that can be heard via her MySpace, and appeared in Ludacris’s music video “One More Drink”. She has recently appeared in Lil Wayne’s new video “Prom Queen” and Young Money video “Every Girl”. She also is working on film/television projects. She is currently filming a music video for her upcoming single “Legalize Me.” It was later revealed that “On My Side” is the lead single with her filming the video in Los Angeles in June. However, “Legalize Me” is released as a digital single, along with a music video, under Woods’ own label Woodgrane Entertainment on iTunes. Woods was a featuring artist for Canadian rapper DY (Die Young) for his second single “That’s My Spot”, which a music video was filmed right before Dy disappeared in Mexico in early September 2010, and has now been confirmed as missing as of November 18, 2010. On November 20, 2010, Woods took to her Twitter account after learning about the disappearance of Schab: “I’m so hurt and worried learning about DY. This news effects me no matter how long I knew him. I’m praying for DY.” She went on to say…,”Last time I saw DY we were joking on set of his video (That’s My Spot). The director said it’s a wrap and we said our ‘see ya later’ to each other.”</p><p>A new single, “Gold Mine”, will be released to iTunes on August 13, 2013, with the release of My Favorite Color EP, Volume 2 following sometime in the fall.</p><p align=justify>On October 14, 2008, Combs declared Woods no longer a member of Danity Kane, as well as bandmate and then-best friend Aubrey O’Day, following a heated discussion with Combs. MTV News gauged fan reactions to the dismissals of Woods and O’Day. Fans left impassioned, long and detailed comments on the MTV News site about their discontent at the group’s breakup. They cited what they felt was a lack of individuality and excitement left within the group. New members were expected to be chosen for Danity Kane as “replacements” for Woods and O’Day, but the group broke up completely early 2009 when it was reported Woods and O’Day, along with group member Shannon Bex, declined the offer to return to the series and the group. O’Day stated that she was unsure if Woods was asked back, but that she herself was not asked to return. Although Woods was fired in 2008, she was “officially” released from her Bad Boy Records contract by Combs February 26, 2009 before the final episode of Making the Band the following April. Despite this, in the April 23, 2009, finale of the series, Combs stated that all five original members would be returning if he ever decided to reunite the group. Woods said she was going to release a full-length album later in the year, in addition to a single that will be released early summer 2009.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>D.
