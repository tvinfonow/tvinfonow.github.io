Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie’s chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick.
