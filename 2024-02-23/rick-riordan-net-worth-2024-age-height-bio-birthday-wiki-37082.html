Riordan also helped Scholastic Press develop The 39 Clues series and its spinoffs, and penned its first book, The Maze of Bones (2008).

If I feel like I can recommend them [to my readers] … we’re going to have them out here in the spotlight.” A focus will be placed on “diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors”.
