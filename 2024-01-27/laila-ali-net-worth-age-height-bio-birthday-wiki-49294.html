Daughter of <a href=#>Muhammad Ali</a> who also became a prizefighter. She went 24-0 in her career, which spanned from 1999 to 2007.</p><p>She defeated <a href=#>Joe Frazier</a>‘s daughter Jackie Frazier-Lyde in a 2001 fight that was deemed Ali/Frazier IV due to the legendary fight trilogy between the two fathers.</p><p>Laila Amaria Ali (born December 30, 1977) is an American television personality and former professional boxer who competed from 1999 to 2007.

As WomenBoxing.com explains: “The near-alignment of the two events focused more attention on female professional boxing than there had been since Christy Martin’s 1996 pay-per-view fight with Deirdre Gogarty.” Ali knocked out Fowler – described by WomenBoxing.com as an “out-of-shape novice” – in the first round.</p><p align=justify>She married <a href=#>Curtis Conway</a> in 2007 and became stepmother to his three children.
