Influential West Coast rapper who released fifteen albums between 1987 and 2012. He is referred to as one of the pioneers of West Coast hip hop and was one of the first rappers to use explicit lyrics about pimping in his songs.</p><p>He featured the vocals of <a href=#>Lil Kim</a> on his song “Call Me.”</p><p>In the mid-1980s, Shaw along with a high school friend Freddy B, produced custom songs (called “special requests”) locally on cassette for people in Oakland and the Bay Area. In 1985, Too Short started his solo career and released his debut album, Don’t Stop Rappin’ on Oakland record label 75 Girls Records And Tapes which, along with four 12″ releases, featured raw, simple drum beats from a LinnDrum drum machine. This was also one of the first hip hop records to use the word “bitch” – a word which became one of the rapper’s trademarks and was the focus of subsequent raps such as Ain’t Nothin’ but a Word to Me.”</p><p>Shaw was born and grew up in South Central Los Angeles, California. In the early 1980s, Shaw and his family moved to Oakland, California. He was a drummer in the band at Fremont High School in Oakland.</p><p align=justify>He raised a daughter named Octavia with his wife Erica Escarcega.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Too Short</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Too</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Short</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Erica Escarcega</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Too Short ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In 1985, Too Short and Freddie B. formed the label Dangerous Music to regionally distribute his music, and with others formed rap group the Dangerous Crew.

With the 1999 release of Can’t Stay Away, Too Short came out of retirement, continuing his sexually explicit, relaxed style of rap. New albums released 2000-2003 were You Nasty (2000), Chase the Cat (2001), What’s My Favorite Word? (2002), and Married to the Game (2003). These albums all charted fairly well, as they all were in the top 71 of the Billboard 200, but they didn’t do quite as well as Too Short’s earlier 1990s releases as none of them reached the top 10.</p><p>Subsequent work was primarily collaborative, including work with Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Scarface, and Pimp C. One of his notable collaborations during this period was on the track “The World Is Filled…” on the classic Notorious B.I.G. album Life After Death; he comes in on the third verse after Diddy and Biggie. Being featured on the album introduced him to a wider audience as well, due to his typical style contrasting greatly with the Mafioso theme of the album. He also appeared on TWDY’s hit single “Player’s Holiday” from their 1999 debut album Derty Werk as well as the Priority Records compilation Nuthin but a Gangsta Party. After these appearances, he began working on his eleventh album, Can’t Stay Away. The album included guest appearances by 8Ball & MJG, Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupri, Sean Combs, E-40, Daz Dillinger, Lil Jon, Soopafly, Scarface and B-Legit.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Too Short height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Too <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A pioneer of West Coast rap, he began recording in 1983, drew renown on Oakland’s underground rap scene, and signed a major deal in 1987 with Jive Records, which released his album Born to Mack. In 1989, his sophomore album, Life Is…Too Short, drew wide notice, and he remained prominent into the 1990s.</p><p align=justify>In 2004, his earlier 1990 single “The Ghetto” appeared on popular video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos.
