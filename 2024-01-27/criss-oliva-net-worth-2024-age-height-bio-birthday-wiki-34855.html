In 1981, Keith Collins joined them to relieve Jon of bass guitar duties. In 1982, the band released an E.P. on Par Records. In 1983, the day before the release of their debut album, “Avatar” were forced to change their name due to copyright issues. Combining the words “Sabotage” and “Avatar”, Oliva (along with his future wife Dawn, his brother Jon and Jon’s wife) came up with “Savatage”. Savatage released their first two albums, Sirens in 1983, and The Dungeons Are Calling in 1985, both on Par Records, exhibiting a variety of musical styles.</p><p>Oliva and his brother Jon formed their first band together, Avatar, in 1978, from the ashes of their former bands Tower and Alien, respectively. In 1980, the duo met up with Steve Wacholz and jammed in a shack behind the Oliva home that was dubbed “The Pit” by the band. They also gave Steve a nickname that would follow him throughout his career: “Doctor Hardware Killdrums”, often shortened to just “Doc”, which referred to Steve’s hard playing style.</p><p align=justify>The man was born in New Jersey and raised in California and Florida.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criss Oliva</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criss</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oliva</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pequannock</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jon Oliva</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dawn Hoppert</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Criss Oliva ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

His biggest dream was for Savatage’s 1991 album Streets: A Rock Opera to achieve platinum status. Streets was Savatage’s biggest mainstream success, and Oliva enjoyed the exposure the record gave the band, allowing new fans to be found for their music. Savatage was rocked, however, by the sudden departures of Jon Oliva and Steve “Doc” Wacholz in 1992 and 1993 respectively. Criss’s best friend Dan Campbell discovered Zachary “Zak” Stevens while in Hollywood California. Dan passed Zak’s Wicked Witch demo directly to Oliva, and thus introduced Zak to the band. Zak was then chosen as the replacement for Jon on lead vocals, and Jeff Plate was selected to replace Doc on drums, and Savatage continued, releasing Edge of Thorns in 1993. The front cover of Edge of Thorns is a painting by artist Gary Smith of Oliva’s wife, Dawn. The face in the trees is supposed to be Jon Oliva, though producer Paul O’Neill disputes that despite its publication in an interview with Criss from 1993. Gary was also responsible for all of Oliva’s airbrushed guitars.</p><h2>Criss Oliva Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Criss Oliva is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United States.

During his lifetime, he released seven studio albums and one EP with the band.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oliva’s grave can be seen at Curlew Hills Memorial Gardens in Palm Harbor, Florida. A special memorial concert took place on November 23, 1993 with the surviving members of Savatage, including elder brother Jon, who returned for one night only, performing a special set. No guitarist played with the band that night, instead opting to leave a white Charvel Predator (Oliva’s signature model) with roses going up the neck which resembled the back cover of the ‘Streets’ album, in the spot where Oliva used to stand. The loss of their lead guitarist nearly signaled the end of Savatage, but during the earlier years the Oliva brothers made an agreement that if one of them were to pass away, the other should continue the band in memory of the other (although some ex-members of the band contest that story). Subsequently, Jon chose to continue the band.</p><p>On October 17, 1993, at around 3:30&nbsp;a.m., Oliva and his wife Dawn were driving north on Highway 301 on their way to the Fourth Annual Livestock Festival held in Zephyrhills, Florida, just north of Tampa. An oncoming car operated by a drunk driver crossed the median and struck Oliva’s 1992 Mazda RX-7 head-on. Dawn survived the crash, but Oliva was killed instantly. The drunk driver, who had seven prior drunk driving (DUI) convictions, survived with minor injuries and was later found guilty of DUI manslaughter, DUI serious injury and vehicular homicide, and served 18 months in prison of a five-year sentence.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Criss Oliva height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Criss <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1984, Oliva married Dawn Marae Hoppert, his girlfriend since his time in middle school at Philippe Park near Safety Harbor, FL. Meanwhile, Savatage continued to flourish, releasing 6 further albums after signing with Atlantic Records in 1985. This was considered the “Golden Age” of Savatage, particularly when the band collaborated with producer Paul O’Neill for the first time in 1987’s Hall of the Mountain King. Oliva’s unique playing style won him many fans, including Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, with whom Savatage toured in 1987 in support of Hall of the Mountain King. When Mustaine was left without a guitarist in 1989 after the departure of Jeff Young, Mustaine’s guitar technician Dan Campbell (and Oliva’s best friend and long time guitar technician) called Oliva to fill the vacant position. Oliva declined the offer, and instead continued with his brother and Savatage. The role of the second guitarist in Megadeth eventually went to Marty Friedman. Savatage continued with the release of Gutter Ballet in 1989, parts of which Jon Oliva wrote of while recovering in rehab.</p><p align=justify>On January 11, 2005, Oliva’s widow Dawn was found dead by her family.</p><h2>Who is Criss Oliva Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Criss Oliva</strong> married to <strong>Dawn Hoppert </strong>.
