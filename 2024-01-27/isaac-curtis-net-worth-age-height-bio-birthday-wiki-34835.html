In 1973 in his first year, the Bengals won the Central Division and faced the eventual Super Bowl Champions, the Miami Dolphins. Don Shula’s defensive backs did not have the speed to cover Curtis and Shula decided that he would have them push, bump, and hold him down the field.

Paul Brown wanted the rule changed, telling the NFL Competition Committee, “What good is it for us to have performers, if they aren’t allowed to perform.”</p><p align=justify>Curtis was a Pro Bowl selection four times (1973–1976) and was selected second team All-Pro for three consecutive seasons (1974–1976).
