Two days before he was due to attend his first class at Michigan, Blue Jays general manager Pat Gillick appeared at Matheny’s home to convince him to sign.

The Blue Jays called Matheny frequently until the morning of his first class, hoping he would sign. However, Matheny was convinced that he would not be a very good professional player at that point, so he chose to attend college instead. Before proceeding to his first class, he called the Blue Jays from his dormitory room to inform them of his decision.</p><p>Matheny was a member of the 1989 Connie Mack championship team.
