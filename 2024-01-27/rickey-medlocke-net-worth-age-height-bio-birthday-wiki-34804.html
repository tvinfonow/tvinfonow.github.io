The artist was also inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame.</p><p>Both he and&nbsp;Gary Rossington&nbsp;were in Lynryd Skynryd.</p><p>Rickey Medlocke (born February 17, 1950) is an American musician, best known as the frontman/guitarist for the southern rock band Blackfoot and a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd. During his first stint with Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1971–1972 he played drums and sang lead on a few songs that would initially be released on 1978’s “First and Last”. Medlocke would rejoin Blackfoot in 1972 and later returned to Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1996 as a guitarist with whom he continues to tour and record today.</p><p>Medlocke recorded shortly with the 1970s era Lynyrd Skynyrd band as a session musician, occasionally playing drums or singing lead on a few songs for them in 1971: “One More Time”, “Preacher’s Daughter”, “Lend a Helpin’ Hand”, “Wino”, “White Dove”, “Comin’ Home”, “The Seasons”, “Ain’t Too Proud to Pray”, and “You Run Around”. On occasion, Medlocke played alongside the band’s original drummer Bob Burns but came to desire the energy of a guitarist at the front of the stage. This resulted in his 1972 decision to reform Blackfoot. The band began touring and producing hit songs that included “Train, Train”, which was written by his grandfather, and “Highway Song”, written by Rickey Medlocke and Blackfoot drummer Jakson Spires, along with songs written by others. He disbanded the group in the early 1990s.</p><p align=justify>His grandparents raised him in Jacksonville, Florida.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rickey Medlocke</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rickey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Medlocke</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jacksonville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rickey Medlocke ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
