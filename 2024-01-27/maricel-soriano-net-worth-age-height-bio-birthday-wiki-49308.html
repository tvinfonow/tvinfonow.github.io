Appearing in a cameo role which lasted only for only 15 minutes, Soriano’s screen presence in the film made an impact as she showed her singing, dancing and acting talent. She was seen in various films in the early 70s like “Dalawang Mukha ng Tagumpay”, “Somewhere over the Rainbow”, “Lady Luck”, “Captain Barbel” and was billed simply as Maricel. However in 1974, she took home the best child actress statuette in the 9th Manila Film Festival by playing the child of Boots Anson Roa and Dante Rivero. In 1973, Ading Fernando noticed her flair for comedy and cast her immediately as Shirley Puruntong, the street-smart, strong-willed yet funny daughter of John and Marsha Puruntung. The sitcom became a huge hit that movie franchises followed in 70s, 80s and 90s. It was in the Iloilo Film Festival in 1974 that she bagged another best child actress for the movie version of “John en Marsha”. She also starred in “Kaluskos Musmos” in 1978 as the feisty newscaster Jacklyn Pusit, Farrah Pusit’s (Chichay) grandchild. It was in 1980, Soriano was the second choice to play the lead in “Katorse” after former child actress Snooky Serna turned down the offer. Since Soriano was not yet ready for daring roles, she begged off and opted to do instead, “Underage” in the same year. Soriano was re-launched into full stardom via Regal Films’ Underage, where her thespian talent and charisma shone brightest among the lead stars of the movie. Her tandem with William Martinez was launched via the hit movie Oh My Mama in 1981. She was considered the top ‘Regal Baby’ in the 1980s and 1990s prompting the Regal matriarch, Lily Monteverde to quip, “Regal without Maricel is nothing”.</p><p>Soriano started acting at the age of six in the 1971 film My Heart Belongs to Daddy with Tirso Cruz III and fellow child actress Snooky Serna. She was brought by her paternal grandmother to Sampaguita Pictures search for a child actress who will portray Tirso Cruz, III’s younger sister. With her dancing, singing and acting skills, she grabbed the part.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Maricel Soriano height</b> Not available right now.
