She first used the screen name Darling Postigo and appeared in her first film entitled Ang Pag-ibig Ko’y Huwag Mong Sukatin as the young daughter of Anson-Roa and Dante Rivero. It was not until she appeared in her first major lead and breakthrough role in the 1978 film Mga Mata ni Angelita that she started using the screen name Julie Vega upon the recommendation of film producer and director Larry Santiago, who owned Larry Santiago Productions which produced the film. She had been chosen to play the title role despite placing only third among over 200 applicants for the role.</p><h2>Julie Vega Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Julie Vega is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actress</strong> from Philippines. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Julie Vega</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was discovered performing at a Christmas celebration held at The Quezon Institute in 1975.</p><p align=justify>She was awarded FAMAS Awards for Best Child Actress twice, in 1979’s Mga Mata ni Angelita and for 1979’s Durugin si Totoy Bato.</p><p align=justify>Named after her parents, Vega was born at the UERM in Quezon City, Philippines to a practicing Roman Catholic family and was the youngest and only girl in a brood of six children of dentists Julio Postigo (1931–1991) from Zamboanga del Sur and the former Perla Apostol (nicknamed Pearl, born 1932) from Iligan City. This fact led her family to nickname her Darling and Tata, which was given to her by her nanny Flor Argawanon and means “youngest child” in the Visayan language.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to Vega, she particularly liked singing because it is through this medium that she is able to best express her inner thoughts and feelings. This became especially true after the loss of her brother Joey, to whom she was particularly very close. Joey was stabbed to death in a car by hired killers, who mistook him for another person they were hired to look for and then kill, while hanging out with his friends in 1983. His untimely death at the age of 22 proved to be devastating for the young Julie, who then repeatedly wished to join him in death.</p><p>Vega was transferred to the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City at about 5:00 p.m on Monday, May 6, 1985 where she died suddenly around 1½ hours later at the hospital’s intensive care unit, just fifteen days shy of her seventeenth birthday. Her cause of death was officially listed as cardiac arrest secondary to bronchopneumonia. Vega’s father Julio would himself die of lung cancer exactly six years later in the same hospital. Her untimely death left Anna Liza with an incomplete storyline and the Filipino people in total shock. After lying in state at Mount Carmel Church in Quezon City, her body was laid to rest right next to those of her father, brother and paternal grandmother at the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City in a funeral attended by millions of grieving fans and colleagues from Philippine showbiz.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Julie Vega height</b> Not available right now.
