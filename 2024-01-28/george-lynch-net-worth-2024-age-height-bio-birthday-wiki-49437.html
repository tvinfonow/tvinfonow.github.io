Songwriter and guitarist in the heavy metal band Dokken, Lynch Mob, and Souls of We.</p><p>He attempted to become&nbsp;Ozzy The Ozzy’s guitar player twice before but was unable to do so both times.</p><p>Lynch played in a late 1970s band called The Boyz, working the Sunset Strip clubs in Hollywood, alongside some of their contemporaries like Van Halen and Quiet Riot. The Boyz also featured future Dokken drummer Mick Brown, bassist Monte Zufelt and vocalists Lisa Furspanker and Greg Sanford and their sound and Lynch’s playing were so similar to Van Halen that one of their demos was circulated as pre-Roth Van Halen recordings The Boyz were to play a showcase for Gene Simmons of Kiss and his startup label. Van Halen opened the show and Gene opted not to stay and see The Boyz. After this Lynch formed Xciter before joining Dokken.</p><p>Lynch was born in Spokane, Washington and was raised in the small town of Auburn, California. Great White guitarist Mark Kendall claims Lynch started two-hand tapping before Eddie Van Halen did, though Lynch himself denies it. Twice Lynch auditioned for the position of Ozzy Osbourne’s lead guitarist, once in 1979 – losing to Randy Rhoads – and another time in 1982 to replace Brad Gillis. According to Lynch, he was hired for three days before Ozzy changed his mind and decided to go with Jake E. Lee. Lee, however claims that Lynch “got the gig, but only went on the road for two weeks to watch the show, and never actually played with Ozzy.” Lynch looks back on the situation positively though; he has said “I won the consolation prize. Randy got to tour with Ozzy…and I got to teach at his mom’s school.”</p><p align=justify>The couple was together for a while.

The album did not do as well as expected and the band was dropped from the label.

By 1996 the band entered the studio and hired producer Kelly Gray who, along with Lynch, Pilson and Brown, wanted to take Dokken in a new direction, to the dismay of vocalist and founder Don Dokken, and released Shadowlife, a complete switch from melodic rock to a more alternative sound. By 1997, tensions had again flared between Don and Lynch, which led to Lynch being replaced by former Europe guitarist John Norum.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>George Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.
