Pearson played college football for the University of Florida, and earned consensus All-American honors. A second-round pick in the 2002 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the NFL and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL.</p><p align=justify>Pearson accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier’s Florida Gators football team from 1999 to 2001. After being red-shirted in 1998, he was a three-year letterman for the Gators, and he received the Gators’ James W. Kynes Award, recognizing him as the lineman who “best exemplified mental and physical toughness and iron-man determination.” He was also a two-time Southeastern Conference (SEC) Academic Honor Roll selection. Pearson played in thirty-five games with thirty-three starts, including two bowl games: the 2001 Orange Bowl and the 2000 Sugar Bowl.

He ultimately regained full health without any amputation and returned to his starting duties at left tackle on September 3, 2007 against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. On November 3, 2007, Pearson suffered a season-ending injury when teammate Chad Folk fell on his ankle.
