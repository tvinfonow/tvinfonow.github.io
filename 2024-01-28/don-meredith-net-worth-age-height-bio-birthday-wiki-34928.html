Don Meredith celebrates birthday on July 13 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Meredith announced on May 9, 2017 that he will be resigning from the Senate. The announcement came shortly after the Senate Ethics Committee found that his conduct “demonstrated that he is unfit to serve as a senator” as “He has abused his privileged position of authority and trust by engaging in behaviour that is incompatible with his office”, and “No lesser sanction than expulsion would repair the harm he has done to the Senate”. Though the Senate has no explicit power to expel a member, a situation unprecedented in Canadian history, the Ethics Committee “accepted the legal opinion of the law clerk and parliamentary counsel to the Senate that the Constitution gives the upper house the same privileges enjoyed by the United Kingdom’s House of Commons, which can permanently eject a member”. Had Meredith not agreed to resign voluntarily, it was “virtually certain his former colleagues would have voted overwhelmingly” to expel him. In his resignation letter he stated that “the path of expulsion being considered by [his] colleagues will have major implications for the Senate of Canada” and that “this is a constitutional fight in which [he] will not engage.” His resignation took effect on May 10, 2017.</p><h3>How many Super Bowls did Don Meredith win?</h3><p>He also led the Cowboys to <b>three Super Bowl victories</b>, one more than Roger Staubach, making him the Cowboys’ quarterback with the most Super Bowl wins.
