He stated, “When I got to high school, I didn’t think it was fair. Ray raised me my whole life, so I did Jackson-Davis. They both want the best out of me, but I would say they do it at different angles.” Trayce has two sisters, Caida Davis and Arielle Jackson, as well as a younger brother Tayven Jackson. Tayven was a high school teammate at Center Grove.</p><p>He made his college debut for Indiana with eight points and six rebounds in a 98–65 win over Western Illinois.
