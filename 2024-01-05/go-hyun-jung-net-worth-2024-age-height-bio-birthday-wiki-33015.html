She was a runner-up in the Miss Korea pageant in 1989, which launched her acting career. Her big break came in the 1995 SBS drama Sandglass. The drama dealt with modern Korean history from 1970 to the 1990s and was one of the highest rated dramas in Korean television history, with average ratings of 50.8% and a peak of 64.5%. People would rush home just to see a new episode, saying “it’s time to go home,” which meant they had to go home to watch Sandglass. However, following her marriage, Go announced her retirement from the industry.</p><p>In May 1995, at the peak of her career, Go married Chung Yong-jin, vice chairman and CEO of Shinsegae Group and grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chull. The two first met in New York purely by coincidence when Chung had offered to help Go find her seat at the Winter Garden Theatre because her English was so bad. After the most talked-about wedding in Korea at the time, Go announced her retirement from acting to focus on her new role as a chaebol’s wife. They had two children together, a boy (born in 1998) and a girl (born in 2000).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Go Hyun-jung</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Grace</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kennedy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1971</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Neungju-myeon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Korea</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chung Yong-jin</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chung Hae-chan, Chung Hae-in</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Go Hyun-jung ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

She debuted in the entertainment scene as a Miss Korea runner-up in 1989 and went on to star in Hourglass , one of the highest-rated and critically acclaimed dramas in Korean television history. She retired after marrying chaebol Chung Yong-jin in 1995, then returned to acting after their divorce in 2003.

She was part of the ensemble cast in arthouse films Woman on the Beach and Like You Know It All by auteur Hong Sang-soo. She then starred in Actresses, a semi-improvisational movie featuring six actresses each playing themselves. Director E J-yong, who was first inspired to make the film after going out for a drink with actresses Youn Yuh-jung and Go in 2007, said he focused on conveying the “reality” of the actresses’ lives.</p><p>Go regained her reputation as Korea’s top actress in 2009 after playing femme fatale royal concubine Lady Mishil in the hit historical drama Queen Seondeok. She was not the titular lead character, but her interpretation of the power-hungry main rival to the queen was impressive enough to make viewers remember the show as Mishil’s story. The drama reached ratings of over 40 percent and won her the highest award at the MBC Drama Awards and Baeksang Arts Awards. Go was voted Actress of the Year Gallup polls for two consecutive years.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Go Hyun-jung height</b> <strong>5 ft 8 in</strong> Grace <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 8 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After eight years of marriage, a messy divorce followed in November 2003, during which she lost complete custody of her children. Two years after the divorce, Shinsegae passed down a ruling stating that none of its department stores would be allowed to display any Go-related material, including any of her product endorsements.</p><p align=justify>Though plagued with production issues prior to airing, Go returned to television ten months later in Daemul, which means “big shot” or “big thing” in Korean. In the drama, Go plays Seo Hye-rim, an anchorwoman who enters politics after the death of her war correspondent husband and becomes the nation’s first female president. The 24-episode series revolves around an ordinary woman in extraordinary circumstances: how and why she became head of state and also the complicated schemes and plots surrounding her, her presidency, allies and enemies. Besides its star-studded cast (Go starred opposite Korean Wave star Kwon Sang-woo), the show’s ratings was helped by its controversial plot, which included events from Korea’s recent past such as a presidential impeachment and the sinking of a Navy warship, and it topped its time slot for 11 consecutive weeks. Go repeated her feat by winning the top prize at the 2010 SBS Drama Awards. According to industry sources, Go was reportedly paid ₩55 million (US$51,000 ) per episode, setting a new salary record for a Korean actress.</p><h2>Who is Go Hyun-jung Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Go Hyun-jung</strong> married to <strong>Chung Yong-jin </strong>.
