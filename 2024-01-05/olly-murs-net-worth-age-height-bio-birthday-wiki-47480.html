The album also charted on the Irish Albums Chart where it found itself peaking at number eleven. The second single was “Thinking of Me”, written by Murs, Steve Robson and Hector, and co-produced by Future Cut and Steve Robson. It was released on 19 November 2010, prior to the album’s release. The single was added to BBC Radio 1’s C Playlist on 3 November 2010. Murs performed the single for the first time on The X Factor.

The song was written by Murs himself and with other songwriters, Claude Kelly and Steve Robson; the single was also produced by Future Cut. The song is about a minor relationship Murs was in where he ended up feeling something for the other person. Murs commented: “Sadly she kept giving me the impression that she didn’t like me as much, and ultimately it didn’t work out, so that’s where the idea of me singing ‘Please Don’t Let Me Go’ came from.” The song was described as “a lovely summery reggae-tinged pop tune that bobs along in a thoroughly hummable and not un-Will Young-like fashion” and said that the music video “is just as quintessentially pleasant”. During the release, Murs was told not to get his hopes up for a number-one due to Katy Perry releasing “Teenage Dream” the same day. On 5 September 2010, the single entered the UK Singles Charts at number 1 beating Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream”.
