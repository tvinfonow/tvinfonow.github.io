Pop singer with a flamboyant personality who initially became famous for her fun song “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” and is a outspoken LGBT rights advocate.</p><p><a href=#>Judy Garland</a> was one of her idols growing up.&nbsp;was one of her idols as she grew as a teenager.</p><p>Cynthia Ann Stephanie Lauper (born June 22, 1953) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and activist. Her career has spanned over 40 years. Her album She’s So Unusual (1983) was the first debut album by a female artist to achieve four top-five hits on the Billboard Hot 100—”Girls Just Want to Have Fun”, “Time After Time”, “She Bop”, and “All Through the Night”—and earned Lauper the Best New Artist award at the 27th Grammy Awards in 1985. Her success continued with the soundtrack for the motion picture The Goonies and her second record True Colors (1986). This album included the number one single “True Colors” and “Change of Heart”, which peaked at number three.</p><p>In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta.</p><p align=justify>She was married&nbsp;She married <a href=#>David Thornton</a> on November 24, 1991 and the couple had a son named <a href=#>Dex</a> together.&nbsp;on November 24, 1991. they had the name of a son&nbsp;Dex&nbsp;with She married <a href=#>David Thornton</a> on November 24, 1991 and the couple had a son named <a href=#>Dex</a> together..</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cyndi Lauper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cyndi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lauper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>David Thornton</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Declyn Wallace Thornton Lauper</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Cyndi Lauper ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like Big Bird, but Rolling Stone magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (“It went lead”, as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy. After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.</p><h2>Cyndi Lauper Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Cyndi Lauper is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.
