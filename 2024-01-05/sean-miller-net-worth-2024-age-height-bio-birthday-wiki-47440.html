Who is Sean Miller dating now & how much money does Sean Miller have?</p><h2>Sean Miller Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Sean Miller</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Basketball Coach</strong> who was born on <strong>November 17, 1968</strong> in Elwood City, Pennsylvania, <strong>United States</strong>. College basketball coach who led Arizona to the Sweet 16 in 2012-13 and the Elite Eight in 2013-14.</p><p>In addition to his coaching career, he was in a cult classic movie The Fish that Saved Pittsburgh, cited by <a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a> as one of his favorites.</p><p>Miller was born in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. The son of John Miller, a Pennsylvania high school basketball coach, Miller was a point guard under his father at Blackhawk High School in Chippewa Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania. He had developed considerable ballhandling skills before that time and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson when he was fourteen years old. His ball handling skills were such that he was featured in the 1979 movie The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh, starring basketball star Julius Erving. In his junior year, he led Blackhawk to the 1986 Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) title. In his senior year, he averaged 27 points and 11 assists per game and helped lead his Blackhawk Cougars to the 1987 WPIAL championship game. After graduation, he chose to play basketball for Pittsburgh.</p><p>Miller played at Pitt from 1987–1992. Despite being a true freshman, he was the starting point guard. Some of his more famous teammates at the time include Charles Smith and Jerome Lane. Many of his teammates recall his knowledge of the game and his leadership qualities. His knowledge of the game allowed him to compete at this level, although he did not have the speed or athleticism of his peers. Jason Matthews, the shooting guard next to Miller, recalls he was the leader of the team, even as a freshman, and that the upperclassmen welcomed him as a leader. Because of his knowledge and leadership abilities, none of his teammates were surprised once he became a top coach in NCAA men’s basketball. Miller’s collegiate statistics are: 128 games played, 1,282 points, 10.0 points per game, 744 assists, 5.8 assists per game, 261 rebounds, 2.0 rebounds per game, and 102 steals.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, the son of a high school basketball coach, and grew up with a talent for ballhandling. He has sons Austin, Braden and Cameron with Amy Miller.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sean Miller</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sean</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Miller</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elwood City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Barb Miller, John Miller</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Archie Miller</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amy Miller</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Austin Miller, Cameron Miller, Braden Miller</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sean Miller ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

This time, he would join Thad Matta’s staff at Xavier as the first associate head coach in the school’s history. The Musketeers won 26 games in each of Miller’s three seasons under Matta, making the NCAA tournament each season. The 2004 season was especially notable. First, the Musketeers won the Atlantic 10 postseason tournament despite having to play four games to do so. Xavier then made a deep run in the subsequent NCAA tournament, finishing with the school’s first-ever appearance in the Elite Eight.</p><p>In the 2010–2011 season, Miller guided Arizona back to college basketball relevance. He led Arizona to its first top 10 ranking in the AP poll since January 8, 2007, and led the Wildcats to their first outright Pac-10 Regular Season Title (its 12th overall), 4th 30+ win season (1st overall), 2nd Elite Eight appearance (9th overall) and its highest coaches poll finish (9th) since the 2004–2005 season. Miller compiled a recruiting class that included 4 ESPNU top 100 recruits (#4 by Scout.com), which was widely regarded as a top ten recruiting class. In addition, Miller led the Wildcats to their first unbeaten home record (17–0) in 14 years and was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year. This was the first time an Arizona coach received this honor since Lute Olson did in 2003. The 17 consecutive home win streak tied for the second most in school history. and is part of a 19-game home streak beginning in the 2009–2010 season. Miller’s recruiting has improved. From not being ranked in the top-25 recruiting classes by ESPN in 2010, Miller would add to the season’s success by guiding the Cats to their first Elite Eight appearance since the 2004–2005 Season as a 5-seed. In the second round, Arizona secured a 2-point victory over 12th seeded Memphis (coached by former Wildcat (and member of the 1997 national title team) Josh Pastner) with a blocked shot in the final seconds by Derrick Williams. Arizona would follow with another close game—a controversial one-point win against 4-seed Texas. In the Sweet-16 match-up, Arizona found itself pitted against top-seeded Duke, the first time since the 2001 title game that the two schools had met. Duke would extend an early lead, but 25 points from Derrick Williams kept the Cats in the game and down by 6 points at the half. In the second half, Williams’ teammates picked up the slack, dominating the Blue Devils by scoring 55 second-half points and routing the defending champs 93–77. Arizona’s run at the Final Four would fall 2 points short, losing to 3-seed (and eventual national champion) Connecticut 65–63.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sean Miller height</b> Not available right now.

He then spent two seasons (1993–95) at Miami (Ohio) under Herb Sendek, during which the team made two postseason appearances. He then returned to his alma mater of Pittsburgh for a season as an assistant under Ralph Willard.</p><p align=justify>After the tournament, Miller was announced to be a possible candidate for the vacant head coaching position at Arizona, which had spent two years under interim head coaches in the wake of the illness and retirement of Hall of Fame coach Lute Olson. He initially turned the job down before changing his mind and accepting the job on April 6, 2009 despite having never visited the Arizona campus. He was succeeded at Xavier by former assistant Chris Mack. Within three months of joining the program, Miller had already assembled a recruiting class ranked #12 in the nation by Scout.com.
