Who is Draco Rosa dating now & how much money does Draco Rosa have?</p><h2>Draco Rosa Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Draco Rosa</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Musician</strong> who was born on <strong>June 27, 1970</strong> in Long Island, NY, New York State, <strong>United States</strong>. Draco Cornelius Rosa Suárez (Spanish:&nbsp;[ˈdɾako koɾˈneljus ˈrosa ˈswaɾes] ; born Robert Edward Rosa Suárez, June 27, 1970), also known as Draco Rosa, Robi Draco Rosa or simply Draco, is a multiple-time Grammy and Latin Grammy winning American-born Puerto Rican musician, singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist, dancer, record producer and entrepreneur.</p><p>In 1988, at age 18, he made his motion picture debut in the film Salsa, which was a big hit in Puerto Rico. During the filming of the movie, he met actress Angela Alvarado who would later become his wife.</p><p>In 1993 a solo contract with Sony Music Latin enabled Rosa to record in Spain the first of his Spanish-language solo albums, Frío.</p><p>Rosa was born Robert Edward Rosa Suárez on Long Island, New York to Puerto Rican parents, Norberto Rosa and Sonia Suárez, and was raised in Peñuelas and Ponce. He is fluent in Spanish, English, German and Portuguese. Draco is married to actress Angela Alvarado with whom he has two sons, Revel, born in 1994, and Redamo, born in 2001. He currently resides in Los Angeles and occasionally in Utuado.</p><p align=justify>At a young age, Rosa moved with his family to Puerto Rico where he spent much of his childhood in the towns of Peñuelas and Ponce. In 1984 he joined the increasingly popular Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. During much of his tenure with the group, he would share the stage with a young Ricky Martin, which would eventually lead to a musical partnership between the two that proved instrumental in launching Martin’s solo career. As the only member of Menudo who had a native grasp of English, Rosa sang lead vocals on many of the English-language tracks released by the group, including their stateside hit, “Hold Me”. However, Rosa started to grow disenchanted with the band, particularly after he was denied the opportunity to write songs for them. Rosa quit the group in 1987.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Draco Rosa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Draco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Draco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>World Music Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Long Island, NY</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Norberto Rosa, Sonia Suárez</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Redamo Rosa, Revel Rosa</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Draco Rosa ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
