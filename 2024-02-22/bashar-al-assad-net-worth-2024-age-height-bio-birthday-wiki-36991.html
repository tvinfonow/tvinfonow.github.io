The president of Syria who came into power in 2000 following the death of his father.&nbsp;He has led the country in power as an dictator, and has employed his army to massacre hundreds of the country’s citizens.</p><p>The father of his son&nbsp;His father <a href=#>Hafez al-Assad</a> served as President of Syria for nearly 30 years.&nbsp;was President of Syria for over 30 years.</p><p>Bashar Hafez al-Assad (Arabic: بشار حافظ الأسد ‎ Baššār Ḥāfiẓ al-ʾAsad, Levantine pronunciation: [baʃˈʃaːr ˈħaːfezˤ elˈʔasad] ; English pronunciation (help ·info ) ; born 11 September 1965) is a Syrian politician who has been the President of Syria since 17 July 2000. In addition, he is commander-in-chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Regional Secretary of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party’s branch in Syria. His father, Hafez al-Assad, was President of Syria from 1971 to 2000.</p><p>During its decades of rule… the Assad family developed a strong political safety net by firmly integrating the military into the government. In 1970, Hafez al-Assad, Bashar’s father, seized power after rising through the ranks of the Syrian armed forces, during which time he established a network of loyal Alawites by installing them in key posts. In fact, the military, ruling elite, and ruthless secret police are so intertwined that it is now impossible to separate the Assad government from the security establishment…. So… the government and its loyal forces have been able to deter all but the most resolute and fearless oppositional activists. In this respect, the situation in Syria is to a certain degree comparable to Saddam Hussein’s strong Sunni minority rule in Iraq.</p><p align=justify>He has three kids along with his partner&nbsp;He has three children with his wife <a href=#>Asma al-Assad</a>, whom he married in 2000.&nbsp;who he got married to in 2000.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bashar Al-Assad</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bashar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Al-Assad</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Damascus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Damascus Governorate</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Syria</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bashar Hafez al-Assad</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Asma al-Assad</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Zein al-Assad, Karim al-Assad, Hafez al-Assad</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bashar Al-Assad ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
