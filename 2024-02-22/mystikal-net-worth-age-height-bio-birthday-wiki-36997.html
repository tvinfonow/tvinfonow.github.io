The album was one of Big Boy’s most successful and gained major success for Mystikal. In 1995, he found himself involved in conflict with fellow New Orleans rappers signed to rival Cash Money Records, including U.N.L.V., Lil Wayne & B.G.. They dissed him on tracks like “Drag ‘Em in Tha River” by U.N.L.V. and “Fuck Big Boy” by The B.G.’z. He struck back with the disses “Beware” and “Here I Go” which were on his second album, Mind of Mystikal. Mystikal’s sister, Michelle Tyler, sang the chorus on “Not That Nigga” and her fate became a major influence on Mystikal’s music after her murder in September 1994. The songs “Dedicated To Michelle Tyler”, “Murder” (both on Mind of Mystikal), “Murder 2”, “Shine” (both on Unpredictable) and “Murder III” (on Let’s Get Ready) refer to her murder. It wasn’t long after their beef that Mystikal and Lil Wayne decided to squash it and become collaborators.</p><p>Mystikal signed to Jive Records and released Mind of Mystikal in 1995. He signed to No Limit Records in 1996 and released Unpredictable in November 1997. He appeared on many of the No Limit albums released from 1997 through a chunk of 2000. He also collaborated with Mariah Carey on her Rainbow album on the track ‘Did I Do That’. In late 1998, he released Ghetto Fabulous. That was his last album with the label, and he left later in 2000 to go on his own.</p><p align=justify>He is the father of a son, Million, and a daughter, My’chelle.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mystikal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mystikal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Orleans</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Million Tyler, My'chelle Tyler</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mystikal ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On January 15, 2004, Mystikal was sentenced to six years in state prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting his hairstylist. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex, and accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. As part of a plea bargain, all three pleaded guilty. Mystikal initially claimed that the incident was consensual, but a videotape of the incident was later found at his home shortly after the charges were made. Negotiations during the trial held the videotape from being entered as evidence and Mystikal agreed to the plea bargain offered by the prosecution, avoiding the mandatory life sentence for sexual battery in Louisiana and expecting to receive probation. However, the case took a twist when the judge viewed the videotape at the sentencing, took into account Mystikal’s two prior arrests (for drug and gun possession), and had him remanded into custody to begin serving a six-year sentence immediately. Mystikal’s bodyguards, Leland Ellis and Vercy Carter, also pleaded guilty to sexual battery.</p><h2>Mystikal Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mystikal is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States.

Though it presented Mystikal’s typical and funky flow style, which had the distinction of drawing comparison to legendary R&B soul screamers Little Richard and James Brown, the song also saw a blending of jazz and swing elements with hip-hop.

On January 11, 2007, Mystikal was released from custody on the federal misdemeanor tax convictions (as his one-year sentence had expired), but he remained in custody on the six-year sentence for the Louisiana state felony convictions. The news of his release caused confusion among fans who heard the news and mistakenly thought he had been released on parole. He was released January 14, 2010.
