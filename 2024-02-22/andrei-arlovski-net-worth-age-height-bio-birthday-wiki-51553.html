Mixed martial artist from Belarus known for holding the UFC Heavyweight title from February 2005 to August 2006. He also has a career in acting, appearing in films like 2009’s “Universal Soldier: Regeneration.”</p><p>He is the first fighter to have defeated <a href=#>Roy Nelson</a> via knockout.</p><p>Arlovski was born in Babruisk, Byelorussian SSR (now Belarus). When he was younger, bullies often picked on him and beat him up. In 1994, when he was 14 years old, he had finally had enough and started lifting weights to put on muscle and, he hoped, to help him deal with these bullies. Arlovski only took up martial arts at the age of 16 in sports such as Sambo, Judo and Kickboxing.</p><p>At the age of 20, Arlovski began his professional MMA career at the Mix Fight M-1 in St Petersburg, Russia on 9 April 1999. It was a fairly inauspicious start, losing by KO to Viacheslav Datsik. Not deterred, Arlovski returned in 2000 to M-1 Global at the European Championships, taking the heavyweight crown with a submission victory and a KO victory.</p><p align=justify>He previously dated Playboy model Patrycja Mikula.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrei Arlovski</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrei</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Arlovski</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MMA Fighter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1979</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Babruysk</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belarus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Walter Schiavone, Antonio Schiavone</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Giuseppina Nappa</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Andrei Arlovski</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Andrei Arlovski ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
