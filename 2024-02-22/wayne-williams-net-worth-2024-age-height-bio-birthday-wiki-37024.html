He was never tried for the child murders and continues to maintain his innocence. Since Williams became a suspect in May 1981,since then there have been no similar killings of young black men.</p><p>Former FBI profiler John E. Douglas wrote in his book Mindhunter that, in his opinion, “forensic and behavioral evidence points conclusively to Wayne Williams as the killer of eleven young men in Atlanta.” He added, however, that he believed there was “no strong evidence linking him to all or even most of the deaths and disappearances of children in that city between 1979 and 1981”.</p><p align=justify>He was raised and born in Georgia.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wayne Williams</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wayne</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Williams</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1958</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georgia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Homer Williams, Faye Williams</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Wayne Williams ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The first automobile to exit the bridge after the splash, at roughly 2:50 a.m., belonged to Williams. When stopped and questioned, he told police that he was on his way to check on an address in a neighboring town ahead of an audition the following morning with a young singer named Cheryl Johnson. However, both the phone number he gave police and Cheryl Johnson turned out to be fictitious.</p><h2>Wayne Williams Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Wayne Williams is one of the <strong>richest Criminal</strong> from United States.

Sanders, a white supremacist affiliated with the KKK and an early suspect in the murders, once praised the crimes in secretly-recorded conversations. Although Sanders did not publicly claim responsibility for any of the deaths, he told an informant for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in the 1981 recording that the killer had “wiped out a thousand future generations of niggers”. An anonymous alleged former friend of Sanders told documentarian Payne Lindsey (Atlanta Monster) that Sanders had taken credit for the murders mentioned in a 1986 Spin article, claiming that his brothers were also involved.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Wayne Williams height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Wayne <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Williams was arrested on June 21, 1981, for the murders of Cater and Payne. His trial began on January 6, 1982, in Fulton County. During the two-month trial, prosecutors matched to a number of victims nineteen sources of fibers from Williams’s home and car: his bedspread, bathroom, gloves, clothes, carpets, dog, and an unusual, trilobal carpet fiber. Other evidence included witness testimony placing Williams with several victims while they were alive and inconsistencies in his accounts of his whereabouts. Williams took the stand in his own defense but alienated the jury by becoming angry and combative. After twelve hours of deliberation, the jury found him guilty on February 27 of the murders of Cater and Payne. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. After Williams became a suspect, the killings stopped.</p><p align=justify>He did not directly implicate the KKK or lead his friend to believe that anyone else from the organization was involved. Sanders allegedly mused over how lucky he was that he and Williams had the same carpet and that they both owned a white German shepherd. The anonymous former friend went on to say that, “Once it was pinned on Wayne Williams, they were through. That was their way out.” Police dropped the probe into possible Klan involvement when Sanders and two of his brothers passed lie detector tests. The case was once again closed on July 21, 2006.</p><h2>Who is Wayne Williams Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Wayne Williams</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

The author James Baldwin, in his essay The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985), raised questions about Williams’s guilt. Members of his community and several of the victims’ parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional teachers, could have killed so many. On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys killed in that county between February and May 1981 that had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the wrong man was blamed for many of the murders.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Wayne Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Criminal</strong>.

Butts County Superior Court judge Hal Craig denied his appeal. Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker said that “although this does not end the appeal process, I am pleased with the results in the habeas case” and that his office will “continue to do everything possible to uphold the conviction.” In early 2004, Williams sought a retrial once again, with his attorneys arguing that law enforcement officials covered up evidence of involvement by the Ku Klux Klan, and that carpet fibers linking him to the crimes would not stand up to scientific scrutiny. A federal judge rejected the request for retrial on October 17, 2006.</p><h3>Where is Wayne Williams today?</h3><p>Williams is serving his sentence at <b>Telfair State Prison</b>.
