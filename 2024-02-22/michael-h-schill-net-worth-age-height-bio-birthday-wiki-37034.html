He built the foundation for change in his path-breaking policy analyses like reducing the cost of new construction in New York City. And he’s built institutions that have a far greater impact than they would without him.” Jerilyn Perine, Executive Director of the Citizens Housing & Planning Council, said “Mike’s work at Furman was marked by his careful, conducted research that policymakers and the public could always rely on.
