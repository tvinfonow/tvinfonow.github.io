He progressed through the Idol series, establishing a strong fanbase and praise from the judges, who often made reference to his afro hairstyle which became a focal point of his image. He was declared the winner on 19 November 2003, and gained a recording contract with BMG, which later merged with Sony. Following his Idol win Sebastian was required to record his debut album in six days, but despite this time restriction the album included three songs co-written by him. He then travelled to the UK to compete in World Idol. Although he impressed the judges, with several suggesting he could win the competition, he finished seventh.</p><p>Sebastian began writing songs before entering Australian Idol. “All I Need Is You”, the second single from his debut album Just as I Am was written when he was a teenager, and fine-tuned during his time on Idol.

Sebastian wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on his albums Beautiful Life and Closer to the Sun, and all the tracks on his albums Like It Like That and Armageddon. In an article in The Daily Telegraph, Kathy McCabe said of his songwriting skills, “Sebastian has matured into a genuine hitmaker, his gift with melody so finely-honed he can pretty much punch out a catchy number in his sleep.” Jamie Horne wrote in The Border Mail, “The inaugural winner’s longevity […] can be attributed to the fact that he’s an accomplished musician and songwriter” and AllMusic reviewer Jon O’Brien said, “it’s a testament to his vocal abilities and songwriting skills that, unlike many of his fellow winners, he’s remained popular enough to see out his rather ambitious Sony contract […] a subtle and natural progression with each album, explains why he’s managed to survive once the show’s publicity machine died down.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Guy Sebastian height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Guy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As a child Sebastian took violin lessons; he would later learn to play guitar, drums and piano, although he has had no formal training in these other musical instruments.
