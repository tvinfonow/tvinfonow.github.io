The two were married on April 15, 1989 when Jennings was 27.

Reverend Carla Dunbar called his comments erronous and degrading. Jennings defended his statements by saying not to listen to how he sounded, but to what he said in defense of the teachings of Biblical modesty in dress and clothing. Jennings agreed to meet with Jamaican entertainer “Mr. Vegas” to debate him. However he had Vegas escorted out of the building by security after an altercation that ensued between Vegas, the church’s audio and visual team, and the other associate ministers on the pulpit.
