Adler!<p>Adler’s research and writing on the Affordable Care Act is credited with inspiring litigation that led to a Supreme Court challenge to the lawfulness of tax credits in states that failed to create their own health insurance exchanges. Professor Adler first wrote an article for a 2011 health care symposium in which he argued that the text of the Affordable Care Act did not authorize tax credits in states that refused to set up their own health insurance exchanges. At the time this did not seem like a significant observation as the Supreme Court had not yet decided NFIB v. Sebelius and it appeared that most states would voluntarily create their own exchanges. As states started to resist implementing the Affordable Care Act, Adler co-authored several pieces with Michael Cannon of the Cato Institute arguing that an IRS rule authorizing tax credits in states that did not create their own exchanges wouldbe unlawful. Adler and Cannon’s arguments were controversial, and prompted significant academic response. Adler and Cannon’s work also prompted several lawsuits challenging the lawfulness of the tax credits, including Halbig v. Sebelius and King v. Burwell. Newsweek proclaimed these cases could “topple ObamaCare.” Adler and Cannon filed amicus briefs defending their research in several of the cases. In the end, however, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Adler and Cannon’s interpretation by a 6–3 vote in King v. Burwell. Adler’s scholarship has also been relied upon in other Supreme Court cases, and was cited by Chief Justice Roberts in his City of Arlington v. FCC dissent.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Judith Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Law Professor</strong>.
