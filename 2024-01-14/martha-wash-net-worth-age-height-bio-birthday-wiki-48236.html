American R&B musician/singer who is known as the Queen of Clubland because of her six number One Dance songs that have been a hit in the Billboard Music Charts.&nbsp;These are Everybody Everybody and Gonna Make You sweat.</p><p>She sang&nbsp;She covered <a href=#>Elton John</a>‘s song I’m Still Standing in 1996 for the soundtrack of the film The First Wives Club.’s song I’m Still Standing in 1996 as part of the soundtrack for The First Wives Club. The First Wives Club.</p><p>In February 1976, Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter Sylvester and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as “the girls”, Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O’ Fun (sometimes referred to as “The Two Tons”). Two Tons O’ Fun debuted as Sylvester’s backing vocalists on his self-titled third album Sylvester, released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album’s singles “Down, Down, Down” and “Over and Over”, which charted at number eighteen on the Billboard Dance chart. In an interview with Daily Xtra!, Wash stated that working alongside Sylvester helped her hone her own vocal stylings. In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album Step II, which also featured The Two Tons’ background vocals throughout the album. “Dance (Disco Heat)”, the album’s lead single which featured The Tons, peaked at number one on Billboard Dance chart and became their first number-one single on that chart. In 1979, Two Tons O’ Fun sang background on Sylvester’s live album Living Proof. Later that year, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records.</p><p>On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album Two Tons of Fun. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: “Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven” and “I Got the Feeling”. Their second album Backatcha was released later that year. The album spawned a single “I Depend On You” that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart.</p><p align=justify>She was raised with their family members within San Francisco, California.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martha Wash</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Martha</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wash</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Francisco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Martha Wash ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Known for her distinctive and powerful voice, Wash first achieved fame as half of the Two Tons O’ Fun, who sang backing for American disco singer Sylvester. After gaining their own record deal, they released three consecutive commercially successful songs which all peaked at number 2 in the dance charts. The duo was renamed The Weather Girls in 1982 after they released the top-selling single “It’s Raining Men”, which brought them to mainstream pop attention. The Weather Girls released five albums and were heavily featured on Sylvester’s albums.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>R&B Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the summer of 1989, Italian house music group Black Box recruited Wash initially as a session singer to demo their upcoming songs. Wash demoed a total of six songs for the group. Despite being recruited strictly for demoing the songs, Black Box retained the use of Wash vocals on the songs and released them on their debut album Dreamland. In December 1989, Black Box released their second single “I Don’t Know Anybody Else”. The song, which featured Wash’s vocals, became an international hit and peaked in the top-ten positions of many countries. The group followed up with release of another single “Everybody Everybody”, also featuring Wash, which became another international success. Despite Wash’s contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited Wash for her vocals and instead used French fashion model Katrin Quinol to lip-sync Wash’s vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. Wash initially became aware of the scandal and sued RCA Records and Black Box for commercial appropriation in September 1990. RCA settled the case out-of-court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a “substantial” financial fee. The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour. In addition, many of Black Box’s releases that contained Wash’s vocals were re-issued with her sleeve credits. Black Box continued releasing singles in 1991 which saw the release of the top-ten international hit “Strike It Up”, “Fantasy” and “Open Your Eyes”.</p><p>In 1989, Wash recorded a song “(You’re My One and Only) True Love” as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction’s debut album Nothing Matters Without Love, released in September 1989, retaining the use of Wash’s lead vocals and added Seduction’s background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Wash’s lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song. “(You’re My One and Only) True Love” was released as Seduction’s second single in July 1989. The single became an unexpected success when it peaked at number twenty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the Dance chart. Wash would eventually file a lawsuit against the producers and A&M Records for unauthorized use of her voice. The case reached an out-of-court settlement in December 1990.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Martha Wash height</b> Not available right now.

The song became their biggest hit, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. Following the success of the song, Two Tons o Fun changed their group name to The Weather Girls. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album Success. The album’s titled-track “Success” was released as the second single and peaked at number eighty-nine on the R&B chart. In 1985, The Weather Girls released their fourth album Big Girls Don’t Cry. In 1986, she released a song “Breakin’ The Ice” on the soundtrack for the Paramount feature film Gung Ho. In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fourth album The Weather Girls, Wash’s final album with the duo. Shortly after the album, The Weather Girls disbanded and Wash took up a solo career and also began working as a session vocalist. She contributed background vocals on Aretha Franklin’s single “Freeway of Love” for her album Who’s Zoomin’ Who? (1988).</p><p align=justify>Wash is also noted for sparking legislation in the early 1990s that made vocal credits mandatory on CDs and music videos after she had been denied credit and royalties for many of the songs she recorded, including the platinum-selling song “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” after she had been labeled “unmarketable” due to her weight. In December 2016, Billboard magazine ranked her as the 58th most successful dance artist of all-time.</p><h2>Who is Martha Wash Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Martha Wash</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

The lawsuit was filed under the truth-in-advertising laws. In the same year, bills were introduced in the New Jersey and New York legislatures to require concert promoters to disclose whether pre-recorded material would be used on stage. Wash’s activism and legal wranglings on behalf of recording artists also resulted in eventual federal legislation making vocal credit mandatory for all albums and music videos.</p><h2>Top Facts about Martha Wash</h2><li>Martha Wash is a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, actress, and producer.</li><li>She was born on December 23, 1953 in San Francisco, California.</li><li>Wash rose to fame as one half of the duo The Weather Girls.</li><li>She provided vocals for numerous hit songs including “It’s Raining Men.”</li><li>Wash has also had success as a solo artist with hits like “Carry On.”</li><li>In addition to music, she has acted in films and television shows.</li><li>Wash is an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and HIV/AIDS awareness.</li><li>She has sold over 20 million records worldwide throughout her career.</li><li>Wash continues to perform and tour around the world today.</li><li>Her powerful voice has been described as a force of nature by critics.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Martha Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular R&B Singer</strong>.

Martha Wash celebrates birthday on December 28 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In November 1990, the C+C Music Factory released their debut single “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)”, which featured Wash’s uncredited vocals on the chorus. The song became an international hit, peaking at number one on Billboard’s Hot 100, and selling over a million copies in the United States. After discovering that the group was using model-turned-singer Zelma Davis in the music video, Wash attempted to negotiate with the producers of the C+C Music Factory for sleeve credits and royalties which ultimately proved unsuccessful. Additionally, the song used an edited compilation of vocal parts that Wash recorded in June 1990 for an unrelated demonstration tape. On December 11, 1991, Wash filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against C+C Music Factory’s Robert Clivilles and David Cole, charging the producers and their record company, Sony Music Entertainment, with fraud, deceptive packaging and commercial appropriation. The case was eventually settled in 1994 and as a result of the settlement, Sony made an unprecedented request to MTV to add a disclaimer that credited Wash for vocals and Zelma Davis (who lip-synched Wash’s vocals in the official music video) for “visualization” to the “Gonna Make You Sweat” music video.</p>You may read full biography about Martha Wash from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfoq6zwMeaZLCZo518</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2024-01-14%2fmartha-wash-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48236.html&text=Martha%20Wash%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2024-01-14%2fmartha-wash-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48236.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2024-01-14%2fmartha-wash-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48236.html&title=Martha%20Wash%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2024-01-14%2fmartha-wash-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48236.html&title=Martha%20Wash%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2024-01-14%2fmartha-wash-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48236.html&title=Martha%20Wash%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2024-01-14%2fmartha-wash-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48236.html&description=Martha%20Wash%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Bio%2c%20Birthday%2c%20Wiki%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=/2024-01-14/martin-mcdonagh-net-worth-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48210.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Martin McDonagh Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=/2024-01-14/mario-elie-net-worth-2024-age-height-bio-birthday-wiki-48249.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mario Elie Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
