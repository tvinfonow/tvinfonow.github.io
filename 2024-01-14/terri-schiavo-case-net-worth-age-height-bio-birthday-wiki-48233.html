Who is Terri Schiavo case dating now & how much money does Terri Schiavo case have?</p><h2>Terri Schiavo case Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Terri Schiavo case</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Legal Case</strong> who was born on <strong>December 3, 1963</strong> in Lower Moreland Township, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Terri Schiavo was born Theresa Marie Schindler on December 3, 1963, in Lower Moreland Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. She struggled with obesity when she was young, eventually losing 100 out of 250 pounds. She attended Bucks County Community College, where she met Michael Schiavo in 1982. The two began dating and were married on November 10, 1984. They moved to Florida in 1986, following Terri’s parents. Michael worked as a restaurant manager, while Terri took up a bookkeeping job with an insurance company.</p><p>The Terri Schiavo case was a right-to-die legal case in the United States from 1990 to 2005, involving Theresa Marie Schiavo (née Schindler) (/ˈ ʃ aɪ v oʊ / ; December 3, 1963&nbsp;– March 31, 2005), a woman in an irreversible persistent vegetative state. Schiavo’s husband and legal guardian argued that Schiavo would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and elected to remove her feeding tube. Schiavo’s parents disputed her husband’s assertions and challenged Schiavo’s medical diagnosis, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of President George W. Bush, caused a seven-year delay before Schiavo’s feeding tube was ultimately removed.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Terri Schiavo case</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Terry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>O'Shea</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Legal Case</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lower Moreland Township</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Robert and Mary Schindler</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Schiavo ​​</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Terri Schiavo case ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>While the bill had been proposed by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martínez, it also had the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability rights groups for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability rights groups traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case, they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin’s support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.</p><h2>Terri Schiavo case Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Terri Schiavo case is one of the <strong>richest Legal Case</strong> from United States.

In May 1998, Michael Schiavo filed a petition to remove Terri Schiavo’s feeding tube, which her parents opposed. Richard Pearse was appointed by the court as a second guardian ad litem (GAL), and on December 29, 1998, reported “Dr. Jeffrey Karp’s opinion of the ward’s condition and prognosis is substantially shared among those physicians who have recently been involved in her treatment.” Pearse concluded from Karp’s and Vincent Gambone’s diagnosis of Persistent Vegetative State that Schiavo was legally in a persistent vegetative state as defined by Florida Statutes, Title XLIV, Chapter 765, §101(12). This includes the “absence of voluntary action” and an “inability to communicate or interact purposefully”.</p><p>From 1990 to 1993, Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers (Terri Schiavo’s parents) enjoyed an amicable relationship, with the Schindlers allowing Michael to live rent-free in their condominium for several months.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Terri Schiavo case height</b> Not available right now.

Quinlan entered a persistent vegetative state in 1975, and her family was allowed to remove her from a ventilator in 1976 after a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court based on her right of privacy. She died of pneumonia in 1985. Cruzan was diagnosed with PVS in 1983 and her legal case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that “clear and convincing evidence” of her wishes to die under such circumstances was needed. Cruzan’s family did not have enough evidence of that, but later produced more. She died after being removed from life support in 1990.</p><p align=justify>On February 25, 1990, at age 26, Schiavo sustained a cardiac arrest at her home in St. Petersburg, Florida. She was successfully resuscitated, but had massive brain damage due to lack of oxygen to her brain and was left comatose. After two and a half months without improvement, her diagnosis was changed to that of a persistent vegetative state. For the next two years, doctors attempted occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy and other experimental therapy, hoping to return her to a state of awareness, without success. In 1998, Schiavo’s husband, Michael, petitioned the Sixth Circuit Court of Florida to remove her feeding tube pursuant to Florida law. He was opposed by Terri’s parents, Robert and Mary Schindler. The court determined that Schiavo would not have wished to continue life-prolonging measures, and on April 24, 2001, her feeding tube was removed for the first time, only to be reinserted several days later. On February 25, 2005, a Pinellas County judge again ordered the removal of Terri Schiavo’s feeding tube. Several appeals and federal government intervention followed, which included U.S. President George W. Bush returning to Washington D.C. to sign legislation moving the case to the federal courts. After appeals through the federal court system that upheld the original decision to remove the feeding tube, staff at the Pinellas Park hospice facility disconnected the feeding tube on March 18, 2005, and Schiavo died on March 31, 2005.</p><h2>Who is Terri Schiavo case Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Terri Schiavo case</strong> married to <strong>Michael Schiavo ​​</strong>.
