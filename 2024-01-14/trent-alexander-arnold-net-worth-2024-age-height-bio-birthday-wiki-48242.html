Who is Trent Alexander-Arnold dating now & how much money does Trent Alexander-Arnold have?</p><h2>Trent Alexander-Arnold Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Soccer Player</strong> who was born on <strong>October 7, 1998</strong> in Liverpool, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Professional soccer player who is recognized for playing the right-back position for the Liverpool Football Club of the Premier League. During the 2016-2017 regular season he made a total of 12 appearances with the organization.</p><p>Both he and <a href=#>Jordan Henderson</a> played for Liverpool F.C.</p><p>Born and raised in Liverpool, Alexander-Arnold joined Liverpool’s academy in 2004 and later captained the club at various youth levels. He made his senior debut in 2016, aged 18, and has since made over 100 club appearances. He won Liverpool’s young player of the season award in both 2017 and 2018, and in the latter year also became the youngest player from the club to start in a UEFA Champions League final. The following year, at the age of 20, he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, named in the PFA Team of the Year and Champions League Squad of the Season, and became the youngest-ever player to start in two consecutive Champions League finals, with Liverpool winning the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final.</p><p>Upon returning from Qatar, Liverpool recorded a 4–0 league win over second-placed Leicester City during a match in which Alexander-Arnold played a hand in all four goals by scoring one, assisting two, and winning a penalty which was converted by Milner. He was later rewarded for his form with the Premier League Player of the Month award, becoming the first full-back to claim the honour since Micah Richards in 2007. Further recognition followed at the turn of the year, when he was named in the 2019 UEFA Team of the Year. Alexander-Arnold then played a starring role in Liverpool’s 2–1 win over Wolves as the club extended their unbeaten run in the league to 40 matches. During the encounter, he assisted captain Jordan Henderson for the opening goal and in the process became the first defender in the competition’s history to reach double figures for assists in multiple campaigns. Towards the end of February, following a 3–2 win over West Ham United, he matched his league assist record from the campaign before and took his overall tally in the Premier League to 25, becoming the third-youngest player in the competition’s history to reach a quarter-century of assists behind Cesc Fàbregas and Wayne Rooney.</p><p align=justify>He is from the United Kingdom, and is both English and British descent.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Trent Alexander-Arnold</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Trent</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alexander-Arnold</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1998</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Liverpool</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In March the following year, Alexander-Arnold endured his most difficult spell with the club to date, after struggling against Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha and Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford in successive weeks. Nonetheless, he retained his position in Liverpool’s starting line-up to become the youngest English player to start in a Champions League quarter-final match and performed strongly in a 3–0 win over English rivals Manchester City in April. His performance saw him named Man of the Match and earned him praise from the media for his ability to nullify City winger Leroy Sané. He impressed again in the reverse fixture as Liverpool eliminated City 5–1 on aggregate to advance to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time in 10 years. On 10 May, his domestic and European form was rewarded when he won the Liverpool Young Player of the Season award for the second season running. Later that month, he became the youngest Liverpool player to start in a Champions League final when he was named in the starting line-up against two-time reigning champions, Real Madrid. Tasked with marking Cristiano Ronaldo, he performed admirably though Liverpool ultimately succumbed to a 3–1 defeat. Following the conclusion of the season, in which he scored three goals in 33 appearances across all competitions, he was nominated for the Golden Boy award where he was later voted runner-up to Ajax defender, Matthijs de Ligt.</p><h2>Trent Alexander-Arnold Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Trent Alexander-Arnold is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Player</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Trent Alexander-Arnold</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He joined Liverpool’s training academy at the age of 6.</p><p align=justify>In May of 2017 he was awarded Liverpool’s Young Player of the Season award.</p><p align=justify>Trent John Alexander-Arnold (born 7 October 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club Liverpool and the England national team.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Alexander-Arnold has represented England at various youth levels and featured at the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Chile. He also scored three goals for the England U19 team, including a brace against Croatia and another against Spain which secured England’s qualification for the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. He did not feature at the tournament itself as Liverpool reached an agreement with England to rest him ahead of the following season’s league campaign, but the Three Lions went on to defeat Portugal in the final to claim their first ever title in the competition. The month following the tournament, he was called up to the England U21 team for the first time for their UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers against Netherlands and Latvia, and made his debut in a 3–0 win over the latter. Two more appearances followed with the U21 side before he was promoted and solidified his status within the senior England camp.</p><p>It was also during his time in the academy that Alexander-Arnold converted from a winger to a right-back as it was the position that offered him the clearest path to the first team and he excelled in his new role, even being singled out by former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who tipped him to have a bright future at the club in his autobiography. As a result of his rapid progression, and in the buildup to the 2015–16 season, Alexander-Arnold was selected in the first team squad by manager Brendan Rodgers for the team’s final pre-season friendly against Swindon Town where he marked his unofficial debut for the club in a 2–1 win.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Trent Alexander-Arnold height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Trent <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>His creative prowess came to the fore once again in May when, during a 3–2 win over Newcastle United, Alexander-Arnold equalled the Premier League record for the most assists by a defender in a season, with his two assists in the match raising his tally to 11. It also saw him and Robertson, who had 11 assists of his own, become the first set of defenders from the same team to record double figures for assists in the same season. Three days later, with Liverpool trailing Barcelona 3–0 on aggregate after a first-leg defeat, he recorded two more assists, including an “instinctive corner” for Origi’s winning goal, to help the club to a 4–3 aggregate victory and progress to a second consecutive Champions League final. On the final day of the domestic season, Alexander-Arnold assisted Mané in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers to break the Premier League record for the most assists by a defender in a domestic campaign, with 12, surpassing previous holders Andy Hinchcliffe, Leighton Baines and Robertson. He then started in the Champions League Final, a 2–0 win over Tottenham, and became the youngest player to start in two successive finals in the competition, breaking the record set by A.C. Milan’s Christian Panucci in 1995. He was later named in the competition’s Team of the Season and nominated for the Defender of the Season award.</p><p align=justify>Alexander-Arnold is widely regarded as one of the best attacking full-backs in world football as a result of his proficiency at occupying attacking spaces on the pitch and creating goalscoring opportunities for his teammates. During the early years of his career, he emerged as one of the Premier League’s most creative players due to his role in assisting goals from early crosses and set-piece deliveries. He possesses an impressive passing range, which is attributed to his development as a midfielder during his time in Liverpool’s youth academy, and has been one of Liverpool’s designated set-piece specialists for deadball situations since the 2017-18 campaign. His set-piece routine, which involves three parallel steps backwards and one to the right, has been likened to that of former rugby union fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. Under Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, whose tactical set-up placed creative responsibility on the shoulders of the club’s full-backs, Alexander-Arnold was predominantly deployed down the right flank where his overlapping runs, switching of play, accuracy of crossing and work-rate in tracking back saw him become an important figure in the side’s transitional, counter-attacking style of play.</p><h2>Who is Trent Alexander-Arnold Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Trent Alexander-Arnold</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

He was booked in the first half for a foul on Ben Davies, which he later revealed could have ended in him being sent off, before being substituted for first-choice right-back Nathaniel Clyne in the 68th minute. Despite the indiscretion, his performance was lauded by Gerrard who once again backed him “to become a top professional”, and also earned a spot in the EFL Cup Team of the Round alongside teammate Daniel Sturridge.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Trent Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Soccer Player</strong>.

On 15 August 2017, he scored his first goal for the club when he struck home from a free kick in a 2–1 first leg Champions League play-off round win over Bundesliga team Hoffenheim. In doing so, he became the third youngest player to score on his European debut for Liverpool, after Michael Owen and David Fairclough. During the group stages of the competition, Alexander-Arnold scored again in a 7–0 Champions League win over Maribor on 17 October, a result which was the joint-largest ever away win in the competition, and largest away win by an English club. He then scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool on Boxing Day, netting in a 5–0 win over Swansea City at Anfield.</p><h3>How much is Trent Alexander Arnold worth?</h3><p>As of January 2022, Trent Alexander-Arnold claimed the highest estimated transfer value of Liverpool FC players, with an estimated value of approximately <b>112.8 million euros</b>, outranking Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah, with values of 79.6 million euros and 66.8 million euros respectively.</p><h3>Where is Trent Alexander Arnold today?</h3><p>Current teams</p><h3>Why is TAA number 66?</h3><p>The No. 66 has no apparent personal significance for Alexander Arnold, and the only reason he continues to wear it is that <b>he has never bothered to have it altered</b>.</p><h3>How do I contact Trent Alexander Arnold?</h3><li>Booking Agent.</li><li>Manager.</li><li>Publicist.</li><h3>Who is the best prayer in Liverpool?</h3><p>Who is the best player in Liverpool FC 2021/2022?
