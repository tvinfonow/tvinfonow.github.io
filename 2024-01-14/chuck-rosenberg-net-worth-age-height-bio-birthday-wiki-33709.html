Charles Philip “Chuck” Rosenberg (born September 10 1960) was the previous interim Administrator at the Drug Enforcement Administration.&nbsp;His appointment came in of 2015 after his resignation from Michele Leonhart.</p><p>Rosenberg was later appointed Director of Staff of Director of FBI (2013-15).&nbsp;In that position Rosenberg was in close contact with James Comey and other senior FBI officials in security, counterterrorism cyber, and criminal investigation issues, and also dealing with federal, international as well as local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.</p><p>On September 26, 2017, it was announced that Rosenberg, dismayed by the Trump administration, was stepping down. His resignation became effective October 1, 2017. It was announced on October 3, 2017 that Robert W. Patterson, who had been serving as the DEA’s Principal Deputy Administrator since November 2016, had succeeded Rosenberg as Acting Administrator for the DEA.</p><p>In August 2017, Rosenberg found himself at odds with the Trump administration over the President’s remarks encouraging the police “be rough” with suspects. His internal memo to the DEA workforce gained public attention for Rosenberg’s repudiation of Trump’s remarks. In it, Rosenberg wrote: “The President, in remarks delivered yesterday in New York, condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement… I write to offer a strong reaffirmation of the operating principles to which we, as law enforcement professionals, adhere. I write because we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong. That’s what law enforcement officers do. That’s what you do. We fix stuff. At least, we try.” The Washington Post editorial board, in a piece titled “A divided nation gets moral guidance – but not from Trump,” wrote: “His letter was important not as a rebuke to the president but as a model of leadership and courage in reaffirming democratic values.”</p><p align=justify>Rosenberg was appointed by George W. Bush and unanimously confirmed by the Senate to be an U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia (2006-08) Prior to that Rosenberg was appointed by Alberto Gonzales to serve as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas (2005-06).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chuck Rosenberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chuck</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rosenberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawyer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Chuck Rosenberg ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
