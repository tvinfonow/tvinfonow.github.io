He grew up in Agoura Hills, California, started playing junior golf at the Lake Lindero Country Club’s Lindero Kids Summer Sports Camp and attended Westlake High School. He finished runner-up at the 2017 U.S. Junior Amateur Golf Championship. After initially committing to play college golf for the University of Southern California, Wolff withdrew his commitment to attend Oklahoma State. In his first year, he earned four runners-up, first-team All-American honors, and the Phil Mickelson Award as the nation’s top freshman. He also made the putt to clinch the 2018 NCAA Division I Championship for Oklahoma State.</p><p>On July 7, 2019, Wolff earned his first PGA Tour victory at the 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities in Blaine, Minnesota. Wolff, 20, shot a 6-under 65 in the final round to edge out fellow Tour newcomer Collin Morikawa and Bryson DeChambeau by one stroke at 21-under overall. The tournament came down to the 72nd green. DeChambeau, playing one group ahead of Morikawa and Wolff, made eagle on the par-5 18th hole and took a 1-shot lead. Wolff’s approach landed on the edge of the green, but he powered a 26-foot putt off the pin and into the hole to take lead with an eagle of his own. Morikawa pushed his potential tying putt to the left and victory belonged to Wolff. The victory gave Wolff a two-year PGA Tour exemption, in addition to a $1.152 million first-place check. Wolff was the first player since Billy Hurley III in 2016 to win after receiving a sponsor exemption. He was also only the third player to win an NCAA title and PGA Tour event in the same calendar year, joining Tiger Woods and Ben Crenshaw.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Matthew Wolff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lambert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Golfer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1999</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Simi Valley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Matthew Wolff ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
