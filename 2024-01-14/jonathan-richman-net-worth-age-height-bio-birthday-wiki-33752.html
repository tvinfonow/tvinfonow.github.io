In 1970, he founded the Modern Lovers, an influential proto-punk band. Since the mid-1970s, Richman has worked either solo or with low-key acoustic and electric backing.

Despite playing live regularly, the Modern Lovers had a difficult time securing a recording contract. By late 1973, Richman wanted to scrap the recorded tracks and start again with a mellower, more lyrical sound, influenced by the laid-back local music he had heard when the band had a residency at the Inverurie Hotel in Bermuda earlier in the year. These stymied efforts to complete a debut album led to the breakup of the original Modern Lovers in February 1974.</p><p>In 1972, they recorded a series of demos with producer John Cale (formerly of the Velvet Underground). Among these songs were the seminal “Roadrunner” and “Pablo Picasso” which were eventually released on the group’s post-breakup album, The Modern Lovers (August 1976). The album was strange for its time, featuring Velvets-influenced basic three-chord rock (“Roadrunner” – based on just two chords – is an homage to “Sister Ray”) at a time when glam and progressive rock were the norm.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jonathan Richman height</b> Not available right now.
