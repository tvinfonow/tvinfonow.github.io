Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>In 1979, Slash decided to form a band with his friend Steven Adler. The band never materialized, but it prompted Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself the role of guitarist, Slash decided to learn how to play bass. Equipped with a one-string flamenco guitar given to him by his grandmother, he began taking classes with Robert Wolin, a teacher at Fairfax Music School. During his first lesson, Slash decided to switch from bass to guitar after hearing Wolin play “Brown Sugar” by the Rolling Stones. His decision to play guitar was further influenced by one of his school teachers, who would play songs by Cream and Led Zeppelin for his students. As a result, Slash stated, “When I heard him do that, I said, ‘That’s what I want to do.” A champion BMX rider, Slash put the bike aside to devote himself to playing guitar, practicing up to 12 hours a day. Slash attended Beverly Hills High School and was a classmate of Lenny Kravitz and Zoro.</p><h2>Slash Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Slash is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Slash</b>'s net worth <strong>$90 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was born to Costume designer Ola Hudson, as well as the artist behind the album’s cover Anthony Hudson.&nbsp;The first band he was in was Tidus Sloan that was formed in 1981.</p><p align=justify>Alongside Guns N Roses, he created the bands with Slash’s Snakepit along with Velvet Revolver and in 2010 the band released their self-titled debut album.</p><p align=justify>Hudson was born in Hampstead, London. He was named after Saul Steinberg, an artist. His mother, Ola J. Hudson (née Oliver; 1946–2009), was an African-American costume designer, whose clients included David Bowie (who his mother later dated), Ringo Starr and Janis Joplin; and his father, Anthony Hudson, is an English artist who created album covers for musicians such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. Of his mixed background, Slash later remarked, “As a musician, I’ve always been amused that I’m both British and black; particularly because so many American musicians seem to aspire to be British while so many British musicians, in the ‘Sixties in particular, went to such great pains to be black.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$90 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Slash owns more than 100 guitars. His guitars are worth a total of $1.92 million. He prefers the Gibson Les Paul, which he has called “the best all-around guitar for me.” Gibson has credited him and Zakk Wylde with bringing the Les Paul back into the mainstream in the late 1980s. His main studio guitar is a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard replica, built by luthier Kris Derrig, which he came to own during the recording sessions for Guns N’ Roses’ debut album, Appetite for Destruction. He used that guitar on every subsequent album he recorded with Guns N’ Roses and Velvet Revolver. For many years, his main live guitar was a 1988 Gibson Les Paul Standard.</p><p>Slash joined his first band, Tidus Sloan, in 1981. In 1983, he formed the band Road Crew—named after the Motörhead song “(We Are) The Road Crew”—with his childhood friend Steven Adler, who by then had learned to play drums. He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what became the Guns N’ Roses song “Rocket Queen”. Slash disbanded the group the following year due to them not being able to find a singer, as well as Adler’s lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan. He, along with Adler, then joined a local band known as Hollywood Rose, which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Following his time with Hollywood Rose, Slash played in a band called Black Sheep and unsuccessfully auditioned for Poison, a glam metal band that he later openly derided.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Slash height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Slash <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During his early years, Slash was raised by his father and paternal grandparents in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, while his mother moved to Los Angeles for work. When Slash was around five years old, he and his father joined his mother in Los Angeles, California. His brother, Albion “Ash” Hudson, was born in 1972. Following his parents’ separation in 1974, Slash became a self-described “problem child.” He chose to live with his mother and was often sent to live with his beloved maternal grandmother whenever his mother had to travel for her job. Slash sometimes accompanied his mother to work, where he met several film and music stars. He was given the nickname “Slash” by actor Seymour Cassel, because he was “always in a hurry, zipping around from one thing to another.”</p><p align=justify>In July 1987, Guns N’ Roses released its debut album, Appetite for Destruction, which as of September 2008 has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which were sold in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. In the summer of 1988, the band achieved its only U.S. No. 1 hit with “Sweet Child o’ Mine,” a song spearheaded by Slash’s guitar riff and solo. In November of that year, Guns N’ Roses released G N’ R Lies, which sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide. As their success grew, so did interpersonal tensions within the band. In 1989, during a show as opening act for the Rolling Stones, Axl Rose threatened to leave the band if certain members of the band didn’t stop “dancing with Mr. Brownstone,” a reference to their song of the same name about heroin use. Slash was among those who promised to clean up. However, the following year, Steven Adler was fired from the band because of his heroin addiction; he was replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult.</p><h2>Who is Slash Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Slash</strong> married to <strong>Perla Ferrar , Renee Suran </strong>.

They played Los Angeles-area nightclubs‍—‌such as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour‍—‌and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. Before one of the shows in 1985, Slash shoplifted a black felt top hat and a Native American-style silver concho belt from two stores on Melrose Avenue in L.A. He combined the hat with parts of the belt to create a piece of custom headwear for the show. He said he “felt really cool” in the hat, and it became his trademark. It was during 1985–1986 that the band wrote most of its classic material, including “Welcome to the Jungle,” “Sweet Child o’ Mine”, and “Paradise City,” As a result of their rowdy and rebellious behavior, Guns N’ Roses quickly received the moniker “Most Dangerous Band in the World,” causing Slash to remark, “For some strange reason, Guns N’ Roses is like the catalyst for controversy, even before we had any kind of record deal.” After being scouted by several major record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Slash Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.
