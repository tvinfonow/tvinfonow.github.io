After graduating from Walters State Community College, he went to Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, where he made friends with songwriters and soon began writing himself. In the mid-1990s, Atkins moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a recording career. He signed with Curb Records in 1996, the same week that LeAnn Rimes did.</p><p>Atkins’s debut single, “In a Heartbeat”, spent one week at number 74 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart dated for August 30, 1997.

His debut album was slated for release on September 17 of the same year, but it was never released due to Atkins’ dissatisfaction with his material. He discussed his dissatisfaction while sitting next to Curb Records owner Mike Curb on an airplane; Curb allowed him to switch producers, and Atkins chose Ted Hewitt, with whom he had been working on demos. Hewitt also changed Atkins’ style from a cowboy appearance and a vocal style similar to Roy Orbison to a more polished appearance. Atkins, Hewitt, and Max T. Barnes wrote the track “Don’t Think I Won’t” on Mark Wills’ 1998 album Wish You Were Here, but he was otherwise inactive until 2002. “In a Heartbeat” later appeared on the soundtrack of the 2008 film Camille.</p><p align=justify>He is married to Tammy Jo McDonald and has a son.&nbsp;He adopted his ex-wife’s daughters from an earlier marriage.&nbsp;He married&nbsp;He has a child with his ex-wife Tammy Jo McDonald.
