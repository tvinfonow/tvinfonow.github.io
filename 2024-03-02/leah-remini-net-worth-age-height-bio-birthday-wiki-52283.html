Responding to criticism of Scientology during an interview on CNN:</p><p>According to former high-ranking Sea Org member Mike Rinder, Remini’s problems with Scientology began when she asked about the whereabouts of Miscavige’s wife Shelly at the 2006 wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and was told by then-spokesman Tommy Davis that she didn’t “have the fucking rank” to do so. Remini then filed a “knowledge report” in which she asserted that Miscavige, Cruise, and other senior Scientology members engaged in behavior that was inconsistent with Church rules. She was subsequently “subjected to years of ‘interrogations’ and ‘thought modification'” that led to her being blackballed within Scientology. Fellow parishioners with whom Remini had been friends for decades wrote internal reports about her, resulting in a Church investigation into her family.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Leah Remini height</b> <strong>5 ft 3 in</strong> Leah <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1991, Remini had a supporting role on the short-lived ABC comedy The Man in the Family.
