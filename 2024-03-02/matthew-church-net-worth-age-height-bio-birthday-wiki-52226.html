Immediately afterwards he made his List A debut, against the same opponents, in the AXA Equity and Law League and made 18. He stayed in both the Championship and one-day sides until the end of the season, albeit with limited success.</p><p>The start of the 1995 season saw Church play only occasionally for the first team, and he never made the impression required to become a regular in the side, with a first-class batting average in the mid-teens and a top score of only 35 in a total of 14 innings in both forms of the game. 1996 was a better year on the face of it, with 280 first-class runs at 25.75, but more than half of those came from just one of his 11 innings, when he hit 152 (almost treble the next highest score of his career) against Oxford University in June. That game also saw Church take his first wicket, that of William Kendall, and go on to record what was to remain his best innings bowling return of 4-50.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Matthew Church</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Matt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hughston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cricketer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Matthew Church ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
