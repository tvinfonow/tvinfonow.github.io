The Beavers went 4–7–1 and 1–10 in Hoke’s first two years in Corvallis, resulting in the firing of Kragthorpe. Hoke was retained in 1991 by Oregon State’s new head coach, Jerry Pettibone. The Beavers had consecutive one-win seasons in 1991 and 1992 and back-to-back four win seasons in 1993 and 1994. Despite the team’s struggles, Hoke later credited Kragthorpe with teaching him many lessons: “One of the big things coach Pettibone instilled in me was the recruiting process, and the work ethic that it takes to recruit, and the other factors, as far as trying to get a team ready every week, coming off a couple of lean years, and the intenseness of the rivalry with Oregon.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Brady Hoke height</b> Not available right now.
