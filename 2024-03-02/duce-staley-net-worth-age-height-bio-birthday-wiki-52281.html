Who is Duce Staley dating now & how much money does Duce Staley have?</p><h2>Duce Staley Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Duce Staley</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>American Football Player</strong> who was born on <strong>February 27, 1975</strong> in Tampa, Tampa, <strong>United States</strong>. Duce Staley (born February 27, 1975) is an American football coach and former running back who is the assistant head coach and running backs coach for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at South Carolina and was drafted by the Eagles in the third round of the 1997 NFL Draft, and during his playing career was best known for his tenure with the Eagles. Subsequently, he was a player with the Pittsburgh Steelers when they won Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks, and was a coach with the Eagles when they won Super Bowl LII against the New England Patriots.</p><p>Staley played in 10 games in 2004, and rushed for 830 yards. He only scored one touchdown however, as Bettis took most goal-line carries, and eventually took over the starting job since Staley missed six games.</p><p>In 2005, after both he and Bettis were injured, Willie Parker, an undrafted free agent, had a stellar season, and Staley, in another injury plagued season, was dropped to third-string, managing only 148 yards in five games, with a 3.9 yard per carry average. The Steelers went on to win Super Bowl XL, giving Staley his first ever championship.</p><p>Staley played just one snap in the Steelers’ 2006 season-opening win against the Dolphins. The Steelers signed former Packers’ running back Najeh Davenport the next day, and deactivated Staley for the rest of the season. On December 3, 2006, the Steelers released Staley. In his three-year tenure with the team, Staley played in just 16 games.</p><p align=justify>Staley is married, with three daughters and three sons. He is a native of Columbia, South Carolina, which is where he resides during the offseason. He underwent an innovative rehabilitation period prior to the 2001 season to become the first skill position NFL player known to return from a Lisfranc injury. He annually holds The Duce Staley Football Camp at West Chester University in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which benefits several charities, including First Steps Program in South Carolina, the Variety Club, and Direct Care for Kids. He launched the Catch 22 Foundation to help single mothers. He donated $25,000 to South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges First Steps early childhood education program in 1999 to help improve education in the state.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duce Staley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duce</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duce</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 27</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1975</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tampa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tampa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>April Staley</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Damani Zihir Staley, Shakia Staley, Kingson Staley, Ziyah Staley</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Duce Staley ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On February 8, 2011, Staley was promoted to special teams quality control coach. After the departure of Andy Reid, Staley remained on the new staff with Chip Kelly and was promoted to the team’s running backs coach. Kelly was fired as the team’s head coach in December 2015 and Staley was interviewed for the vacant head coaching job in January 2016. Staley was retained as the team’s running backs coach by new head coach Doug Pederson on January 20, 2016. On February 4, 2018, Staley won his first Super Bowl as a coach, and second overall, as the Eagles defeated the Patriots, 41–33, in Super Bowl LII. On February 20, 2018, Staley was promoted to assistant head coach while maintaining his running backs coach position.</p><h2>Duce Staley Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Duce Staley is one of the <strong>richest American Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Duce Staley</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>As a senior at South Carolina in 1996, Staley was ranked 13th in the nation in rushing with 1,116 rushing yards. In his collegiate career at South Carolina, Staley attempted 345 rushes for 1,582 yards (4.58 per average). He also caught 59 passes for 489 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p align=justify>Staley was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1997 NFL Draft and played for the Eagles through the 2003 season. After his rookie season and the departure of Ricky Watters, Staley became the starter in a tumultuous 3–13 season which led to the dismissal of head coach Ray Rhodes. Under Andy Reid, Staley developed into the team’s perennial leading receiver through Reid’s screen-heavy West Coast offense. However, he played in only five games of the 2000 season due to a serious Lisfranc fracture. Staley also missed some playing time in 2001 due to a shoulder injury. Entering the 2003 season, Staley held out of training camp in an attempt to bargain for a new contract, as he was in the last year of his deal. With Correll Buckhalter coming back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and Brian Westbrook entering his second season, the Eagles decided not to budge. This resulted in shared playing time among the three, as Westbrook became the premier back by season’s end. They were known as the “Three-Headed Monster”. Consequently, the Eagles decided to not re-sign Staley.</p><p align=justify>Staley signed a five-year, $14 million contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers on March 9, 2004. Staley had rooted for the Steelers when he was growing up. He instantly became the number one running back for his new team, and was seen as the eventual heir apparent for Jerome Bettis, who at the time had the sixth-most career rushing yards in NFL history.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The “Duce Staley drill”, a practice drill that Staley created to enhance players’ footwork, was added to the NFL Scouting Combine in 2020.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Duce Staley height</b> Not available right now.
