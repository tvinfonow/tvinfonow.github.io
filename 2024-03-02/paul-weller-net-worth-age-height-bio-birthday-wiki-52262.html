Weller achieved fame with the punk rock/new wave/mod revival band The Jam.

Weller started his education at Maybury County First School in 1963. His love of music began with The Beatles, then The Who and Small Faces.

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Weller’s musical vocation was confirmed after seeing Status Quo in concert in 1972. He formed the first incarnation of The Jam in the same year, playing bass guitar with his best friends Steve Brookes (lead guitar) and Dave Waller (rhythm guitar). Weller’s father, acting as their manager, began booking the band into local working men’s clubs. Joined by Rick Buckler on drums, and with Bruce Foxton soon replacing Waller on rhythm guitar, the four-piece band began to forge a local reputation, playing a mixture of Beatles covers and a number of compositions written by Weller and Brookes. Brookes left the band in 1976, and Weller and Foxton decided they would swap guitar roles, with Weller now the guitarist.</p><h2>Paul Weller Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Paul Weller is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Paul Weller</b>'s net worth <strong>$10 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He started to love music when he attended the school Sheerwater County Secondary.

Although every subsequent single had a placing within the Top 40, it was not until the band released the political “The Eton Rifles” that it would break into the Top 10, hitting the No.&nbsp;3 spot in November 1979. The increasing popularity of their blend of Weller’s barbed lyrics with pop melodies eventually led to their first number one single, “Going Underground”, in March 1980.</p><p>The Jam emerged at the same time as punk rock bands such as The Clash, The Damned, and the Sex Pistols. However, it better fitted the mold of the new wave bands who came later; and, being from just outside London rather than the city itself, it never really was part of the tightly-knit punk clique. Nonetheless, The Clash emerged as one of the leading early advocates of the band, and were sufficiently impressed to take them along as the support on their White Riot tour of 1977.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Weller height</b> <strong>5 feet 11 inches</strong> Paul <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 11 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite widespread critical recognition as a singer, lyricist, and guitarist, Weller has remained a national, rather than international, star and much of his songwriting is rooted in British culture. He is also the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s mod revival, and is often referred to as “The Modfather”.</p><p align=justify>As the band’s popularity increased, however, Weller became restless and wanted to explore a more soulful, melodic style of music with a broader instrumentation, and in consequence in 1982 he announced that The Jam would disband at the end of that year. The action came as a surprise to Foxton and Buckler who both felt that the band was still a creative formation with scope to develop further professionally, but Weller was determined to end the band and move on. Their final single, “Beat Surrender”, became their fourth UK chart topper, going straight to No.&nbsp;1 in its first week. Their farewell concerts at Wembley Arena were multiple sell-outs; their final concert took place at the Brighton Centre on 11 December 1982.</p><h2>Who is Paul Weller Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Paul Weller</strong> married to <strong>Hannah Andrews , Dee C.

The Style Council’s death knell was sounded in 1989 when its record company refused to release its fifth and final studio album, the house-influenced Modernism: A New Decade. With the rejection of this effort, Weller announced that The Style Council had split, and although the final album did have a limited vinyl run, it was not until the 1998 retrospective CD box set The Complete Adventures of The Style Council that the album would be widely available.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Paul Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rock Singer</strong>.
