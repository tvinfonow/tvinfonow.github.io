With no money to carry on racing, Rotorua businessman Christopher Wingate provided Dixon and his mentor, Kiwi racing hero Kenny Smith, with both money and airfares between New Zealand and Australia to ensure Dixon’s career moved ahead. Dixon won Rookie of the Year and third overall in the 1997 Australian Drivers’ Championship driving the Ralt Australia prepared Reynard. This resulted in him being offered a drive with top team SH Racing. As the budgets were going to exceed $250,000, Wingate suggested a company be formed to fund Dixon’s career. That company was called Scott Dixon Motorsport (SDMS), funded by shareholders who over the next two years invested more than $1m in Dixon. This allowed him to pursue his career without worrying about money. In 1998 Dixon won the Australian Drivers’ Championship outright. That win brought offers to race in the Australian V8 Supercar series but that was not where he wanted to make his mark, so arrangements were made for him to go to the US to test in the Indy Lights series.</p><p align=justify>Dixon remained with PacWest, owned by Bruce McCaw of McCaw Cellular, for 2002 but it soon became clear the team was woefully short of cash due to the dot com crash. When it eventually collapsed, Toyota arranged an introduction to Target Chip Ganassi Racing which added a third car to its squad to accommodate Dixon. It was his first experience of a true top-level team, which had the then top engine supplier, Toyota. Dixon posted 12 top-ten finishes, including a second place at Denver.</p><h2>Who is Scott Dixon Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Scott Dixon</strong> married to <strong>Emma Davies </strong>.
