Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Paul Boyd's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update Paul Boyd's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>According to the animation industry website Cartoon Brew, other than Ed, Edd n Eddy, Paul Boyd also worked for The Mr. Hell Show and provided animation for Gary Larson’s Tales from the Far Side and the first Flash animation television series ¡Mucha Lucha! An incomplete list of his animation credits can be found on IMDb. During the 1990s he taught many young animators at the Vancouver Film School. A prize in his honour for the top student in Classical Animation at the Vancouver Film School is funded by his family and presented three times per year. At the time of Paul’s death he was working at the Global Mechanic studio. His last completed work was on two animated advertisements for the Alberta Government.</p><h2>Paul Boyd Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Paul Boyd is one of the <strong>richest Animator</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Paul Boyd</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He attended the University of British Columbia and Concordia University.</p><p align=justify>He was nominated for an Annie Award in 2001 for his work as a co-director for the show Aaagh! It’s the Mr. Hell Show!.</p><p align=justify>About 30 minutes later, across the street from the second of the two clinics, he approached a man sitting on a bus stop bench, again mistaking him for someone he knew, shouting at him when this was denied and then kneeling to apologize for his actions. A witness in a 6th floor apartment, seeing him kneeling on his backpack and shouting mistook his backpack for a prone man and believed an assault was taking place. The witness phoned 911 and reported an assault. Because he reported seeing the man sitting on the bus stop bench, his call was reported by the 911 dispatcher as a two-on-one assault.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Animator</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the meantime, two uniformed officers had arrived. Boyd grappled with one of them and then attempted to flee the scene. The other uniformed officer, Constable Lee Chipperfield, drew his weapon and began shooting. There were reports from the police, released to the media on August 14, 2007, that Boyd had begun swinging a bicycle chain with a lock attached after he struck the plain clothes officer. Subsequent forensic DNA tests failed to show that he had been swinging this chain. The only DNA on the chain was that of the officer who had been struck. Since there was no blood or hair on the chain, it is likely that this DNA resulted from the careless handling of the evidence after the incident—without being put into an evidence bag, it was thrown into the front seat well of the unmarked police car in which the injured officer had arrived at the scene. Only one of the officers involved could describe this chain and he stated that it seemed to be “a chain-saw chain with a heavy block of metal attached”. The officer who described this chain had handled it himself apparently did not understand the difference between a chain-saw chain, each of whose links has a sharp blade attached (and would cause severe cuts if handled with bare hands) and an ordinary bicycle chain. The “heavy block of metal” was a small padlock. Civilian witnesses described Boyd swinging an object variously described as a belt, a purse, a rope, or a chain, but none described the bicycle chain that the VPD had alleged he was swinging. Many of the witnesses said that the object being swung was a light object about 18″ long but others described a long heavy object. Some described an object (e.g. a purse or wallet) attached to the end of a chain but others insisted that there was nothing attached to the end of the chain. There were two chains found at the scene, a loop of bicycle chain 88″ in length with a 2″x2″ padlock attached and a light link chain, 22″ in length, described by a civilian witness and a police officer as being “made of paperclips”. It was this smaller chain that the witness sitting on the bus stop bench described precisely and testified that Boyd was swinging. This smaller chain was not tested by forensic analysis to confirm or deny this.</p><p>During the evening of August 13, 2007, Boyd was seeking medical treatment at two clinics on Granville Street in Vancouver. Although he had taken his psychiatric medication that day, as revealed by the report of a forensic toxicologist, he was acting bizarrely, addressing strangers as friends and shouting loudly. About 9 PM, he had come to the attention of the staff and patrons at a sushi restaurant next door to one of these clinics. He mistook a patron for someone he knew, shouted at him when that was denied and then knelt before him to apologize for his shouting. This incident resulted in a number of 911 calls whose callers recognized that he was showing signs of mental illness.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Boyd height</b> Not available right now.

He was a member of a.k.a. Cartoon, the production team for Cartoon Network’s longest running television series, Ed, Edd n’ Eddy, as a title sequence animator and director. He was responsible for creating the opening sequence of the series. He began his career working for International Rocketship on two Gary Larson specials. During his career he taught at Vancouver Film School and worked at many animation studios in Vancouver. His work directing for Aaagh! It’s the Mr. Hell Show!, along with co-director Moose Pagen, was nominated for an Annie Award in 2001.</p><p align=justify>The murder was investigated by the Vancouver Police Department and their findings passed on to the Criminal Justice Branch of BC which decided not to prosecute Chipperfield. After a Coroner’s Inquest in December 2010 revealed many details which did not figure in the Criminal Justice Branch report, a complaint was filed by the B. C. Civil Liberties Association to the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner alleging that excessive force had been used. In March 2012, the British Columbia Police Complaint Commissioner issued a report concluding that there was not “clear, convincing and cogent evidence … that Chipperfield used unnecessary force or excessive force during this incident.” He based his conclusion partly on an opinion provided by a use-of-force expert, Bill Lewinski, who suggested that Chipperfield could have been suffering from “inattentional blindness.”</p><h2>Who is Paul Boyd Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Paul Boyd</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

A video recorded by tourists showed Boyd being shot nine times after wielding a bicycle chain at officers who came to respond to a disturbance involving him. The ninth shot that struck Boyd was fired as he was on the ground. The officer who shot Boyd was cleared in the death. The use of force was criticized by many of Boyd’s colleagues and relatives.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Paul Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Animator</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Paul Boyd celebrates birthday on September 30 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Two plain clothes Vancouver Police Department officers arrived on the scene in an unmarked car in response to this 911 call. They reported that Boyd was calm and that there were only two men at the scene, Boyd who had stood up from a kneeling position and a second man, still sitting on the bus stop bench and also calm. There was no third man nor any evidence of an assault having taken place. However, one of the officers reported that he saw a hammer in Boyd’s hand and, without identifying himself as a police officer, drew his weapon and ordered Boyd to drop the hammer and lie down, which he did. As the other officer approached Boyd in an attempt to handcuff him, he sprang up and struck the officer on the temple causing him to fall down bleeding from a wound to the head. Early reports from the Vancouver Police stated that this officer was unconscious but the officer’s evidence was that he was never unconscious and got to his feet almost immediately. Regarding the alleged hammer, at the Coroner’s Inquest into Boyd’s death the man who had been sitting on the bus stop bench testified that he saw no hammer in Boyd’s hand. An ordinary household claw hammer was found on the sidewalk at the scene but it was not tested forensically to determine who had handled it. Although the police press release on the day after his death stated that he had struck the officer with a bicycle chain with a lock attached, there is no evidence that this was the case (see the discussion of the physical and forensic evidence in the next paragraph). The wound suffered by the officer was a scalp wound and there was no injury to the skull or sign of concussion which is inconsistent with an injury caused by a heavy swung chain. The Criminal Justice Branch in 2010 stated that “he struck the officer with a chain or other object.” The wound was not inconsistent with a blow from a closed fist, especially from someone as muscular as Boyd.</p><h3>What happened to the creator of Ed Edd n Eddy?</h3><p>He was <b>shot and killed</b> on August 13, 2007, by a police officer, Lee Chipperfield, in Vancouver.</p><h3>Where was Paul Boyd shot?</h3><p>Vancouver, Canada</p><h3>What is under Edd's hat?</h3><p><b>There is nothing under Edd’s hat but it was given to him by his mother for comfort</b>.
