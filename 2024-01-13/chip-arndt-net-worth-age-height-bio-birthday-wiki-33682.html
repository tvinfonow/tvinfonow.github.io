He worked for five years as an investment banker for Morgan Stanley as well as in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. He then entered Harvard University for an MBA in 1996. He was president of the Harvard Graduate School Leadership and Ethics Forum, chairman and founder of the Annual Harvard Business, Law, and Kennedy School of Government Debate, and president of the Harvard Business School Gay and Lesbian Student Association.</p><p>Arndt and former partner Reichen Lehmkuhl competed against eleven other teams the fourth season, taped in January and February 2003, and premiering in May. The couple, who had met in 1999 while Reichen was still in the United States Air Force, had a commitment ceremony on February 2, 2002. While not legally married, they had asked that CBS identify them as a married couple. The identification of a gay couple as married drew criticism from anti-gay groups. By the final episode, Reichen and Chip had an 83% popularity rating on the show’s official website. Arndt performed seven of eleven roadblocks (tasks only one team member can perform). In total, they placed second on five legs of the race, with their win on the final leg being their second first place, eight minutes ahead of runners up Kelly and Jon. The finale was broadcast on August 21, 2003, with CBS winning both its time slot and the night. Season 4 would later win an Emmy award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chip Arndt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Christophe</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Deylaud</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Activist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>West Hartford</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Chip Arndt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
