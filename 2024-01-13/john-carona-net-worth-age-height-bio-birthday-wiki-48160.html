John Joseph Carona (born 14 December 1955) was an ex- Republican Member of the Texas Senate from District 16 located in Dallas County, Texas.</p><p>It was May 2012. the rift between Carona and her colleague Dan Patrick of Houston, also a co-worker, a Republican and Baptist was widely reported across the state.&nbsp;A letter exchange was exchanged between the two. Patrick was accused by Carona of propagating false rumors regarding Patrick’s relationship; Carona has denied questioning Patrick’s marriage , or commented on Patrick’s sexuality.&nbsp;Carona also said her friend Patrick: “I’ve never been shy about sharing my dislike and distrust of you. Put bluntly, I believe you are a snake oil salesman, a narcissist that would say anything to draw attention to himself.”</p><p>In the 2013 legislative session, Carona chaired the Senate Committee on Business and Commerce. He was also a member of the Senate Criminal Justice, Education, Jurisprudence and Redistricting committees.</p><p>In 2014, Patrick was himself a runoff candidate against Dewhurst, who after losing to Cruz was seeking a fourth term as lieutenant governor. While Patrick led a four-candidate field for lieutenant governor, with Dewhurst a distant second, in the primary election held on March 4, 2014, Carona was himself very narrowly unseated for his state Senate seat by Dallas businessman Don Huffines (born c. 1958), 25,136 (50.6%) to 24,501 (49.4%). Patrick ultimately defeated Dewhurst in a runoff election on May 27, 2014.</p><p align=justify>According to reports, the fight was motivated by the fact that 2012 was the year to be the successor to David Dewhurst as lieutenant governor in the event that Dewhurst had been chosen to be elected into Senate. United States Senate.&nbsp;However, Dewhurst fell in during the Senate primary election in a runoff to the fellow Republican Ted Cruz.&nbsp;If Dewhurst quit the post of lieutenant governor at the beginning of 2013, state senators would have picked the person they would have chosen to be the interim lieutenant governor who would remain until January 2015.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John Carona</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carona</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas City</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Helen Carona</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeff Carona, Joey Carona</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>John Carona ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
