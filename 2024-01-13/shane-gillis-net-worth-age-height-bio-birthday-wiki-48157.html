Later that day, freelance journalist Seth Simons posted clips, since removed from YouTube, of an episode of Matt and Shane’s Secret Podcast from 2018 in which Gillis makes a joke that included alleged racist remarks about Chinese people in which he used the epithet “chink”. In other clips, podcast hosts McCusker and Gillis rank comedians by race, gender, and sexual orientation and use homophobic slurs. That night, Gillis posted a tweet saying that he was a “comedian who pushes boundaries” and that “if you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you’re going to find a lot of bad misses. I’m happy to apologize to anyone who’s actually offended by anything I’ve said.” On September 16, 2019, a spokesperson for Lorne Michaels announced that Gillis would not join the show in light of the controversy. Gillis has since appeared on SiriusXM’s “Bennington” and “Jim Norton and Sam Roberts”, as well as the podcasts “The Tim Dillon Show”, “History Hyenas”, “Artie Lange’s Halfway House”, and “Flagrant 2” to tell his side of the story. Gillis maintains that while the clips look bad, they were taken out of context and he was misquoted in the majority of articles reporting the story. He also says that he immediately regretted using the “I’m a comedian who pushes boundaries” statement, blaming it on having “literally 5 minutes of being pressured to write anything”, regretfully adding the statement was “corny” and that he officially retracts the statement.</p><h2>Shane Gillis Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Shane Gillis is one of the <strong>richest Comedian</strong> from United States.

His friendly demeanor distracts you, while he sneaks in just a whiff of social insight within a barrage of self-deprecating sex jokes.”</p><p>Gillis made national headlines in 2019, when he was announced as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, only to be fired from the show four days later, due to backlash from resurfaced clips from his podcast featuring jokes that were found to be racially insensitive.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Shane Gillis height</b> Not available right now.
