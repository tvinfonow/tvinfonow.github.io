As Gant was trying to make it back to first base to avoid Twins pitcher Kevin Tapani’s pickoff, he claimed Hrbek pulled his leg off the base during the swipe tag and Gant was called out. Drew Coble, the first base umpire, ruled that Gant’s momentum would have carried him off the bag, and refused to change his call. Aiding the controversy the commentators at the time remarked that it appeared that Hrbek had in fact lifted Gant off the bag and that his 235-pound frame helped him lift the lighter Gant who weighs only 172 pounds. Also, New York Times writer Claire Smith wrote that “Hrbek seemed to lift Gant’s leg right off the bag as the Braves’ center fielder fought to keep his balance.” This play caused the Braves bench to empty during the argument.</p><p align=justify>1997 was the low point of Gant’s career when he struck out 162 times and batted .229 for the Cardinals.
