Pop and dance artist known for singing the theme from Titanic, “My Heart Will Go On.” She won the Chopard Diamond Award for selling over 200 million albums.</p><p>She named one of her children Nelson in honor of <a href=#>Nelson Mandela</a>.</p><p>Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, 24 kilometres (15&nbsp;mi) northeast of Montreal, the youngest of 14 children of Thérèse (née Tanguay, 1927–2020), a homemaker, and Adhémar Dion (1923–2003), a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent. She was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family, and she was named after the song “Céline”, which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her birth. On 13 August 1973, at the age of five, the young Céline made her first public appearance at her brother Michel’s wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau’s song “Du fil des aiguilles et du coton”. She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents’ small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, “The Old Barrel”. From an early age, she had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People magazine, she recalled, “I missed my family and my home, but I don’t regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.”</p><p>Dion first met her husband and manager, René Angélil, in 1980, when she was 12 and he was 38, after her brother, Michel Dondalinger Dion, sent him a demonstration recording of “Ce n’était qu’un rêve” (“It Was Only a Dream/Nothing But A Dream”), a song she, her mother the former Thérèse Tanguay, and her brother Jacques Dion had jointly written and composed.
