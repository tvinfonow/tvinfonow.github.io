Country singer who was the first to release “Five Minutes” as a single.&nbsp;Her career has seen her release more than ten albums.</p><p>She was married to Brad Thompson who was&nbsp;Clint Black’s&nbsp;bus driver.</p><p>Loretta Lynn Morgan (born June 27, 1959) is an American country music singer. She is the daughter of George Morgan, widow of Keith Whitley, and ex-wife of Jon Randall and Sammy Kershaw, all of whom are also country music singers. Morgan has been active as a singer since the age of 13, and charted her first single in 1979. She achieved her greatest success between 1988 and 1999, recording for RCA Records Nashville and the defunct BNA Records. Her first two RCA albums (Leave the Light On and Something in Red) and her BNA album Watch Me are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The 1995 compilation Reflections: Greatest Hits is her best-selling album with a double-platinum certification; War Paint, Greater Need, and Shakin’ Things Up, also on BNA, are certified gold.</p><p>Morgan’s employment at Acuff-Rose led to her signing with that company’s Hickory Records label, which issued two singles in 1979: “Two People in Love” and “Tell Me I’m Only Dreaming”. Respectively, these were written by Eddy Raven and Liz Anderson, and both made the lower regions of the Hot Country Songs charts that year. Another single, “I’m Completely Satisfied with You”, featured electronically overdubbed vocals from her father, and also made the charts by year’s end. During the early 1980s, Morgan continued to tour primarily in night clubs, and served as an opening act for Billy ThunderKloud & the Chieftones, Jeannie Seely, and Jack Greene among others. She also toured as a backing vocalist for George Jones, made guest appearances on the television series Nashville Now, and in 1984 became the youngest inductee of the Grand Ole Opry.

During her marriage to Thompson, she suffered from ovarian cysts which led to a hysterectomy. Morgan began dating American football player Troy Aikman in late 1993, but they amicably separated by year’s end. From 1994 to 1996, Morgan was romantically linked to actor and politician Fred Thompson. Morgan observed that her relationship with Thompson increased her personal interest in political matters, but also caused her to “stop and think about the political implications of everything before I uttered a word in public.” She also observed that she wished to marry Thompson, but felt that his political background would keep him from accepting her for who she was.</p><h2>Lorrie Morgan Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Lorrie Morgan is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.

Also certified platinum by the RIAA, it accounted for four Hot Country Songs entries between then and early 1992: “We Both Walk”, a cover of George Jones’ “A Picture of Me (Without You)”, and “Except for Monday” all reached top ten, while title track reached number fourteen in early 1992. The album also included a duet with Dolly Parton titled “Best Woman Wins”, which also appeared on the latter’s 1992 album Eagle When She Flies. Richard Landis produced the album except for the duet, which Parton produced with Steve Buckingham and Gary Smith. Contributing songwriters included Skip Ewing, Reed Nielsen, and Chris Waters. Brian Mansfield of AllMusic reviewed Something in Red favorably, noting that it had fewer “sad songs” than its predecessor while highlighting the “laidback country and ballads like the title track”.</p><p>Morgan’s third album, Watch Me, was issued on BNA Records (then known as BNA Entertainment). The title track was the first single, achieving a peak of number two on Hot Country Songs in 1992. The followup “What Part of No” became her second number-one single on that chart, holding that position for three weeks. After this came “I Guess You Had to Be There” and “Half Enough”. The album featured backing vocals from Dale Daniel and The Remingtons, two other acts recording for BNA at the time; Richard Mainegra and Rick Yancey of the latter group also wrote the closing track “She’s Takin’ Him Back Again”. As with the previous album, Landis again served as producer. Mansfield praised the album as being superior to its predecessors, but criticized “What Part of No” and Morgan’s cover of Bonnie Tyler’s “It’s a Heartache”. Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly rated the album “B”, stating that “Morgan is a take-charge singer with more than a little vulnerability beneath her steely surface as well as an ability to adopt pop stylings without straining her country credibility.” Watch Me became her third consecutive platinum album by the end of 1993.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Lorrie Morgan height</b> <strong>5 ft 1 in</strong> Lorrie <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Morgan signed to RCA Records Nashville in 1988 and issued her debut single “Trainwreck of Emotion” that year. The song reached number 20 on the Hot Country Songs chart and served as the lead single to her debut album Leave the Light On. Following the song were the top-ten hits “Dear Me”, “Out of Your Shoes”, and then “Five Minutes”, which became her first number-one single in 1990. The album’s last single, “He Talks to Me”, also reached top ten. Barry Beckett was the album’s producer, and contributing songwriters included Mike Reid, Jon Vezner, and Beth Nielsen Chapman. Following the album’s last single, RCA also issued “‘Til a Tear Becomes a Rose”, a duet between Morgan and Keith Whitley from the latter’s Greatest Hits album. The song would later win Vocal Event of the Year from the Country Music Association. Thom Owens of AllMusic reviewed Leave the Light On favorably, calling it “a skilled and assured blend of traditional country, honky tonk, country-rock and modern pop sensibilities that pointed the direction toward the sound, style and musical eclecticism of ’90s contemporary country.” The Chicago Tribune writer Jack Hurst rated the album four out of four stars, referring to it as “fine, well-produced songs and a compelling performer”. In 1993, Leave the Light On earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies.</p><p align=justify>Morgan released her first Christmas album, Merry Christmas from London, at the end of 1993. The album featured orchestral accompaniment from the New World Philharmonic orchestra, and duets with Tammy Wynette (a medley titled “A Christmas Festival”), Andy Williams (“Little Snow Girl”), and Johnny Mathis (“Blue Snowfall”). Roch Parisien of AllMusic panned the album for lacking in country sound. The album charted two seasonal entries on Hot Country Songs: a rendition of “My Favorite Things” in late 1993, and of “Sleigh Ride” two years later. Morgan sang “Little Snow Girl” with Williams as part of a Christmas special hosted at his Moon River Theater in Branson, Missouri which also aired on the television network PBS, and said that she chose to perform with him because she had been a fan of his music since childhood. A year after the album’s release, Morgan began a special holiday tour which featured her performing songs from the album with orchestral backing. She also made her acting debut in this timespan, starting with the 1993 made-for-TV movie Proudheart on the defunct TNN (The Nashville Network). It featured her in the starring role as an assembly-line worker who moves back to a small town in Tennessee after the death of her father. In 1994, she portrayed the lead role in a television pilot for CBS called Lorelei Lee. The show focused on a country music-singing detective, but the pilot was not picked up for series. The following year, she appeared in the ABC TV movie The Stranger Beside Me.</p><h2>Who is Lorrie Morgan Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Lorrie Morgan</strong> married to <strong>Randy White </strong>.

Also included were two cover songs: Jeannie Seely’s “Don’t Touch Me” and George Jones’ “A Good Year for the Roses”, which she recorded as a duet with Sammy Kershaw.
