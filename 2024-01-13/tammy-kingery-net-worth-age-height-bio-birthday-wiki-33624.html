He did, and afterwards went to run some errands with his two sons. When they returned, the house was locked and Tammy was not there. A note inside the house, apparently left by Tammy, said she was going for a walk and would be back soon, but she never returned and has not been seen since.</p><h2>Tammy Kingery Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tammy Kingery is one of the <strong>richest Nurse</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Tammy Kingery</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Kingery, a native of Northwest Indiana, met her husband Park Kingery there in the mid-1990s when the two worked together at a local drugstore. On September 20, 1994, the two were engaged. After their marriage, the couple had three children and settled down in a house they built in a wooded area of Edgefield County, South Carolina, just north of North Augusta, near where Park Kingery had gotten a job as a welder. After finishing a degree in nursing in 2001, Tammy took a job as a nurse in a local branch of the NHC Healthcare nursing home. She was still working there in September 2014.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nurse</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After the initial searches, police decided to thoroughly investigate Park Kingery again. His account of his actions and whereabouts on the morning Tammy disappeared was corroborated both by independent interviews with his sons, cell phone pings and security camera footage from the stores he and the younger son had visited. He also took a lie detector test, which he told Tammy’s mother made him nervous. After initially telling the Curious Times podcast almost a year after Tammy’s disappearance that the police told him some of the results were “questionable”, he told the Investigation Discovery channel’s Disappeared series in 2016 that police had asked him not to talk about it.</p><p>Alternatively, given the possibility that someone else may have been involved, Tammy may have been abducted or killed. “I’ve always thought maybe someone just got in the house and took her”, Kingery said, recalling how many of her personal items were left behind. The family has asked police to search bodies of water in the area they may have bypassed before. The chief investigator on the case for the sheriff’s department said in 2016 that a body would have floated to the surface by then.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tammy Kingery height</b> <strong>5&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (160&nbsp;cm)</strong> Ted <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (160&nbsp;cm)</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>During the first weeks of September, Tammy seemed to be suffering physically—according to Park she had missed a few days of work, which was unlike her. She often went to bed shortly after returning from work. Park says Tammy believed no treatment would work. In the middle of that month, around September 16, Tammy began having trouble sleeping. One night she woke up sweating so severely she had to change her clothes. She confided this to her two sisters, with whom she spoke regularly. They advised her to make an appointment to see the doctor, which she did, for September 21.</p><h2>Who is Tammy Kingery Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tammy Kingery</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
