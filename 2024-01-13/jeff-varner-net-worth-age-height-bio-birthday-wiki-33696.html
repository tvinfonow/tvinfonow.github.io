Who is Jeff Varner dating now & how much money does Jeff Varner have?</p><h2>Jeff Varner Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jeff Varner</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Reality Star</strong> who was born on <strong>April 16, 1966</strong> in Kalamazoo, Michigan, <strong>United States</strong>. Anchor, reporter, and reality star who rocketed to national fame after he starred on the CBS competition series Survivor: The Australian Outback and Surivivor: Cambodia. He is also recognizable as an anchor for stations in Los Angeles and throughout North Carolina.</p><p>He and Survivor: The Australian Outback castmate <a href=#>Colby Donaldson</a> competed together on Rock & Roll Jeopardy.</p><p>Varner was a contestant on Survivor: The Australian Outback, 2001. He was a member of the Kucha tribe, and made it to the merge, but not the core group of nine, as there was a tie between him and Colby Donaldson. At the time, in the event of a tie, previous tribal council votes would be used. Because Keith Famie and Tina Wesson knew this, and Tina had no votes against her before while Keith had several of them (mostly from Jerri Manthey and her allies), Keith’s request to Tina when they had both lasted for hours in the Immunity challenge and were the last two players standing (phrased as “I need this”) led to Tina ending her run so that Keith was safe, and giving Kucha no one to vote for who had more votes than Varner: Jeff had two but knew only of one, while Colby had zero. It was revealed on the Survivor: Australia DVD, in the special commentary section, that it was Kimmi Kappenberg that inadvertently gave away the vote he had against him during the Episode Two Reward Challenge. This is also mentioned by Varner in the episode in which he was voted off, early in the episode while the Kucha tribe is talking in their shelter at night.</p><p>Varner was, until September 2014, main anchor at WNCT-TV, the CBS affiliate in Greenville, North Carolina. Prior, he worked as a general assignment reporter for WPIX-11, the CW’s flagship station in New York City. He has worked as an entertainment reporter for KCBS in Los Angeles then E! News Live, and then as a field correspondent and host for the TV Guide Channel. He was a weekend anchor and reporter at FOX 8 WGHP in High Point, North Carolina. Varner has been a fill-in host for Live with Regis and Kelly and also worked for many years as morning anchor at WWMT Channel 3 in Kalamazoo, MI before being promoted to main anchor. He held that chair until he left the station in April 2011.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan and raised on a tobacco farm in Greensboro, North Carolina. He eventually settled in New York City.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff Varner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Varner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reality Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kalamazoo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jeff Varner ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was initially placed on the Mana tribe. At the first Tribal Council, he joined the majority in voting out Ciera Eastin. At Mana’s second Tribal Council, he joined the majority in voting out Survivor: Cagayan winner Tony Vlachos. Varner, along with Sandra Diaz-Twine, Malcolm Freberg, Aubry Bracco, and Michaela Bradshaw were then switched to Nuku. They joined original Nuku member James “J.T.” Thomas, Jr., winner of Survivor: Tocantins. At the fifth Tribal Council, Varner joined Diaz-Twine and Bradshaw in blindsiding Thomas. Varner and Diaz-Twine remained on Nuku after the second tribe switch, but were excluded from the alliance of new members Ozzy Lusth, Andrea Boehlke, Tai Trang, Sarah Lacina and Zeke Smith. At Tribal Council, both Varner and Diaz-Twine voted for Trang, but the rest voted against Diaz-Twine, thus sending her out of the game for the first time in her Survivor career. She was replaced on Nuku by the recently-exiled Debbie Wanner.</p><h2>Jeff Varner Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jeff Varner is one of the <strong>richest Reality Star</strong> from United States.

On May 20, the results revealed that both Varner and Kappenberg from The Australian Outback were voted to return. It was revealed that Varner had been part of a pre-game alliance prior to the start of filming, with three other players: Terry Deitz and Shane Powers of Survivor: Panama, and Kelly Wiglesworth of Survivor: Borneo. Although Powers did not make it into the season, Deitz and Wiglesworth did, and the two of them ended up with Varner on the same Ta Keo tribe. Early in the game, Varner was seen as a crucial player in the season: He and Peih-Gee Law from Survivor: China were the swing votes who ultimately decided the elimination of Vytas Baskauskas on Day Three, and Varner himself organized the elimination of Shirin Oskooi on Day Six. However, after a tribal swap and expansion turned the two tribes into three, Varner and Law ended up on the brand new Angkor tribe, along with fellow former Ta Keo members Yung “Woo” Hwang and Abi-Maria Gomes, and two new members from the former Bayon tribe, Latasha “Tasha” Fox and Andrew Savage. Although Varner initially planned to simply stay with his former Ta Keo allies, Fox suddenly realized this was his plan after they lost the immunity challenge and called Varner “a rat” in front of the other tribes. As a result, Varner began to panic and decided to turn on one of his own allies, ultimately voting with the majority to send Law home on Day Nine. After their tribe lost again on Day 11, Varner was eliminated in a unanimous vote, placing 17th in the overall competition.</p><h2>Who is Jeff Varner Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jeff Varner</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
