(He had earned a B.A. in Economics the previous year at the Stockholm School of Economics.) His first academic venture beyond Scandinavia brought him to California, where he studied physics at the University of California, Berkeley, earning his M.A. in 1992, and Ph.D. in 1994 under the supervision of Joseph Silk.</p><p>With Daniel Eisenstein and Wayne Hu, he introduced the idea of using baryon acoustic oscillations as a standard ruler. With Angelica de Oliveira-Costa and Andrew Hamilton, he discovered the anomalous multipole alignment in the WMAP data sometimes referred to as the “axis of evil”. With Anthony Aguirre, he developed the cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics. His 2000 paper on quantum decoherence of neurons concluded that decoherence seems too rapid for Roger Penrose’s “quantum microtubule” model of consciousness to be viable. Tegmark has also formulated the “Ultimate Ensemble theory of everything”, whose only postulate is that “all structures that exist mathematically exist also physically”. This simple theory, with no free parameters at all, suggests that in those structures complex enough to contain self-aware substructures (SASs), these SASs will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically “real” world. This idea is formalized as the mathematical universe hypothesis, described in his book Our Mathematical Universe.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Max Tegmark</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maximilian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rupp</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stockholm</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sweden</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Harold S.
