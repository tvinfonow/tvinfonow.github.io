Famous as a professional bodybuilder with the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness, Cutler won four Mr. Olympia titles between 2006 and 2010.</p><p>After finishing second to <a href=#>Ronnie Coleman</a> in the 2001 and 2003-2005 Mr. Olympia contests, he beat Coleman in 2006 to win his first Mr. Olympia title.</p><p>Cutler worked in his brother’s concrete construction business, Cutler Bros. Concrete, from the age of 11. He began training when he was 18 years old as a senior at Wachusett Regional High School. He graduated from Quinsigamond Community College in 1993 with a degree in criminal justice, intending to work as a corrections officer for a maximum security prison. He was inspired to enter bodybuilding after meeting personal trainer Marcos Rodriguez. Cutler excelled in bodybuilding, desiring to be one of the largest competitors ever, and took his first overall win in 1993 at the Iron Bodies Invitational. His first contest was the 1992 Gold’s Gym Worcester Bodybuilding Championships, at which he took second place. As he established a name for himself in the bodybuilding scene, he often appeared in bodybuilding-related videos including Battle for the Olympia 2001, a pre-contest documentary video directed by Mitsuru Okabe that highlighted many competitors as they prepared for the 2001 Mr. Olympia Competition. He went on to win consecutive Arnold Classic titles in 2002, 2003, and 2004, and placed second to Ronnie Coleman in the Mr. Olympia competition four times before claiming the title for the first time in 2006.</p><p>At the 2001 Mr. Olympia, Cutler tested positive for banned diuretics, but sued and had his second-place finish reinstated. Cutler won the Olympia for a second consecutive year in 2007. He became the third Mr. Olympia in history (after Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu) to win the title in non-consecutive years after defeating the reigning champion Dexter Jackson in 2009. In 2010, he won his fourth Mr. Olympia title, defeating Phil Heath. In 2011, Cutler was runner-up to Heath at the Mr. Olympia.
