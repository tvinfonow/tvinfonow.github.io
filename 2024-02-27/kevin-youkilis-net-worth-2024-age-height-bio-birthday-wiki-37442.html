He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati —an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis’ longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. “I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody”, said Cleary. “I’d love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had.”</p><p>While majoring in finance, Youkilis excelled as a player for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. “I take no credit”, said Cleary. “He coaches himself. He knows his swing. Any time we said anything to him, he was already a step ahead. He made the adjustments he had to make. I just think he’s a really smart guy who had a great feel for what he had to do.” In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. “He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [who] in a uniform didn’t look all that athletic”, Cleary said. “He wasn’t a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. … It wasn’t fat. He was strong. [But] I think the body did scare some people away.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Kevin Youkilis height</b> <strong>6 feet 1 inches</strong> Kevin <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 1 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Youkilis was named a reserve for the 82nd All-Star Game.
