She had been chosen to play Counsellor Deanna Troi before Gene Roddenberry switched the roles that she and Marina Sirtis had originally been given. Initially one of the top-billed characters and featured prominently in episodes such as “The Naked Now” and “Code of Honor”, the role of Tasha gradually moved into the background as other members of the ensemble cast became a greater focus of the series. It has been reported that Crosby grew disillusioned with her role because of its “Uhura-like” status: “I was struggling with not being able to do much with the character. I had all these ideas and couldn’t do them. I was just stage dressing.” Ultimately, Crosby decided to leave the show. Her character was killed by the alien creature Armus during the episode “Skin of Evil”. She had appeared in 22 episodes when she left.</p><p>Crosby’s choice of career solidified at an early age and was influenced by her grandfather Bing Crosby and her father Dennis Crosby.

In the early 1990s, she played the role of the mayor in the short-lived series Key West. She also appeared in two episodes of the cable television series Red Shoe Diaries, playing a different character in each episode. Crosby had a small recurring role in Aaron Spelling’s prime time drama, Models Inc, a spin-off from Melrose Place. She was a guest star on the eighth season of The X-Files for two episodes, in which she plays a doctor who examined Agent Scully’s baby. In 1991, she was a guest star in “The Deadly Nightshade”, a first season The Flash episode as Dr. Rebecca Frost. In 2006, she was a guest star in “Popping Cherry”, the third episode of the first season of Dexter, appearing via flashback as the victim of Dexter’s first serial killing.
