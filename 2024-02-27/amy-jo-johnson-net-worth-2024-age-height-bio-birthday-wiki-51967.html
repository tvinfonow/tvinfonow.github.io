Johnson’s character in Felicity was originally described as a dancer, but with Johnson’s input, the producers rewrote the character as a singer and guitarist. As a result, Johnson was able to perform her own song, “Puddle of Grace”, on the show. This song was included in the album Felicity Soundtrack (1999) successfully released by Hollywood Records. As a result of the reception of the song, another Johnson song, “Clear Blue Day”, was also featured on the show. In The Division, her song “Cat in the Snow” is the theme song from one of the episodes. In Flashpoint, her songs “Dancing In-Between” and “Goodbye” were featured.</p><p>In the early 2000s, Johnson had roles in Interstate 60, Pursuit of Happiness, and Infested, as well as television film Hard Ground. She also had guest starring roles on Spin City and ER. In 2004, she starred as Stacy Reynolds in the fourth season of The Division. In the latter half of the decade, she had recurring roles in Wildfire and What About Brian, and she starred in television films Magma: Volcanic Disaster on Syfy and Fatal Trust on Lifetime.

Despite the series being a huge success and having brought Johnson international recognition as an actress, the show brought her little financial security, as she and the others were paid only $600 a week for their work on the show, which included stunt work and public appearances; none of the cast received any royalty payments from re-runs of episodes they appeared in. As a non-union show, physical danger on set presented a very real threat to Johnson; while filming Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, she was almost set on fire during a stunt and, during Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, she was almost electrocuted. Johnson ultimately made the decision to leave the show in 1995, passing the role of the Pink Ranger to Australian actress Catherine Sutherland. In an appearance on I Love the ’90s, Johnson jokingly stated that having been the Pink Power Ranger was something she would “never live down.” In later years, Johnson stated that becoming famous from the show was at times overwhelming and had given her nightmares, but that overall, she learned many things and is grateful to the show and her fans. In all, Johnson’s character appeared in 137 episodes in the franchise, her final TV appearance being in a 2014 episode of Power Rangers Super Megaforce. She, alongside former co-star Jason David Frank, made a cameo appearance in the 2017 film Power Rangers, though not as Power Rangers.</p><p align=justify>Beginning in 2008, Johnson became a series regular on Flashpoint as Constable Jules Callaghan, a member of the fictional Strategic Response Unit of the Toronto Police service. She was nominated for a Gemini Award for her performance. The show aired new episodes through 2012.</p><h2>Who is Amy Jo Johnson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Amy Jo Johnson</strong> married to <strong>Olivier Giner </strong>.
