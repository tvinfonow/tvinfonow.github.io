Etling finished the game with 241 yards passing while throwing two touchdowns and two interceptions. During the ensuing week, Etling was named the starter for the Boilermakers against Nebraska. Purdue struggled in Etling’s first start, losing 44–7. Overall, Etling appeared in eight games, passing for 1690 yards, ten touchdowns, and seven interceptions, with a 116.1 quarterback rating.
