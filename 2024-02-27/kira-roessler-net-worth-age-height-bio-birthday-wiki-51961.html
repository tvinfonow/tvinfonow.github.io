Who is Kira Roessler dating now & how much money does Kira Roessler have?</p><h2>Kira Roessler Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kira Roessler</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Bassist</strong> who was born on <strong>June 12, 1962</strong> in Connecticut, Connecticut, <strong>United States</strong>. Bassist who played on five albums by the seminal California punk rock band Black Flag. Following the band’s breakup, she joined former husband Mike Watt in the two-bass duo known as Dos.</p><p>She played with frontman <a href=#>Henry Rollins</a> in Black Flag from 1983 to 1985.</p><p>Members of Black Flag heard her playing while she was sitting in with L.A. punk group DC3. This led to her being asked to join Black Flag in 1983 to replace founding member Chuck Dukowski. Vocalist Henry Rollins later reported that Greg Ginn, Black Flag’s leader, guitarist and primary songwriter, had grown frustrated with Dukowski’s failure to progress as a musician beyond the band’s hardcore punk roots and was drawn to Roessler’s more nimble and sophisticated playing. Roessler was majoring in applied engineering at UCLA, and Black Flag’s subsequent tours were worked around her school schedule, which was a condition for her to join the band. Her bass playing was featured on five of Black Flag’s studio albums and two officially released live albums. During her early live performances with the band she was sometimes mistaken as male due to her androgynous appearance, and she subsequently dressed in more glamorously traditional female garb for the band’s tours. She remained in the band until completing touring behind their album In My Head in the autumn of 1985, then graduated from UCLA in 1986.</p><p>After Black Flag, she formed the two-bass duo Dos with Mike Watt (to whom she was married between 1987 and 1994). Dos’ most recent album was released in 2011. She wrote or co-wrote songs for what would be the Minutemen’s final album, 3-Way Tie, and contributed lyrics to Watt’s post-Minutemen band Firehose. She later contributed artwork to Watt’s first solo album, Ball-Hog or Tugboat?.</p><p align=justify>She was married to The Minutemen bassist Mike Watt from 1987 to 1994. Her brother is Paul Roessler, who played keyboards in punk rock bands like The Screamers and 45 Grave.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kira Roessler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kira</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roessler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bassist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mike Watt</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kira Roessler ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
