Who is Rockin' Robin dating now & how much money does Rockin' Robin have?</p><h2>Rockin' Robin Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Rockin' Robin</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Wrestler</strong> who was born on <strong>October 9, 1964</strong> in Charlotte, North Carolina, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Smith and her brother Sam Houston are the children of Aurelian “Grizzly” Smith and were born after his first marriage dissolved. Her half-brother is Jake “The Snake” Roberts, who was born during their father’s first marriage. Robin and her brothers all wrestled in the WWF at the same time in the 1980s, but their relationship was never mentioned on-screen at the request of Robin. Author and former National Wrestling Alliance president Howard Brody alleges in his book Swimming with Piranhas that Robin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her father. According to Brody, Robin was removed from her father’s care when her mother discovered what had been happening.</p><p>Smith grew up in a wrestling family and enjoyed going to wrestling shows, where she claims she and her siblings were treated like celebrities. Smith later decided to become a professional wrestler and trained, along with her sister-in-law Nickla Roberts (known by her ring name Baby Doll), under Nelson Royal. During 1987, Smith competed as Rockin’ Robin in Wild West Wrestling, where she feuded with Debbie Combs and Sue Green. When the WWF decided to restart their women’s division in the late 1980s, both women tried out for the company, but the role ultimately went to Smith. Smith, as Rockin’ Robin, debuted in the WWF in late 1987. She competed at the first Survivor Series as a member of The Fabulous Moolah’s team. Throughout 1988, she feuded with Sensational Sherri for the WWF Women’s Championship.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rockin' Robin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roneisha</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>McGregor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charlotte</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>North Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Grizzly Smith</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Smith, Jake Roberts</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rockin' Robin ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
