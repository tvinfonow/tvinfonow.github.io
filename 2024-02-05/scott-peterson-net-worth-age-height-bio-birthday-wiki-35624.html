In 2004, he was convicted of the first-degree murder of his pregnant wife, Laci Peterson, and the second-degree murder of their unborn son, Conner, in Modesto, California, and in 2005, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. His case is currently on automatic appeal to the Supreme Court of California.</p><p>While at California Polytechnic, Peterson worked at a restaurant in Morro Bay called the Pacific Café. One of his co-workers would receive visits from a neighbor named Laci Denise Rocha, who also attended Cal Poly as an ornamental horticulture major. When Peterson and his future wife first met at the restaurant in mid-1994, Laci made the first move, sending him her phone number. Immediately after meeting him, Laci told her mother that she had met the man that she would marry. Peterson later called Laci and they began dating, their first date being a deep-sea fishing trip on which Laci got seasick. As Peterson’s relationship with Laci grew more serious, he put aside his dreams of professional golf in order to focus on a business path. The couple dated for two years and eventually moved in together. In 1997, after Laci graduated, they married at Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort in San Luis Obispo County’s Avila Valley. While Peterson finished his senior year, Laci took a job in nearby Prunedale. Prosecutors have stated that around this time, Peterson engaged in the first of at least two extramarital affairs, though they have not revealed a name or details of each relationship. Peterson graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural business in June 1998. After their graduations, the Petersons opened a sports bar in San Luis Obispo called The Shack. Contrary to a Los Angeles Times story that reported that Peterson’s parents loaned him money to open the establishment, his parents emphatically told the San Francisco Chronicle that they did not, believing it was a bad investment. When the couple had difficulty finding a technician to install a needed vent in the restaurant, Peterson took the necessary certification course in Los Angeles in order to install it himself. Business was initially slow, but eventually improved, especially on weekends. The Petersons sold The Shack in 2000 when they moved to Laci’s hometown of Modesto to start a family. In October 2000, they purchased a three-bedroom, two-bath bungalow house for $177,000 on Covena Avenue in an upscale neighborhood near La Loma Park.</p><p align=justify>His father Lee was the owner of a crate-packing company as did his mom Jacqueline ran a store located in La Jolla.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott Peterson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scott</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peterson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Diego</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jackie Peterson, Lee Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anne Bird, John Edward Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Laci Peterson</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Conner Peterson</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Scott Peterson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Under cross-examination, March admitted basing his findings on an anecdote from one of Laci’s friends that she had taken a home pregnancy test on June 9, 2002. When prosecutors pointed out that no medical records relied on the June 9 date, March became flustered and confused on the stand and asked a prosecutor to cut him “some slack”, undermining his credibility. Summing up this key defense witness, Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles said, “There were moments today that reminded me of Chernobyl.” According to one newspaper account about March’s testimony, “By the end of his testimony Thursday, legal analysts and jurors closed their notebooks, rolled their eyes, and snickered when they thought no one was looking”.</p><h2>Scott Peterson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Scott Peterson is one of the <strong>richest Criminal</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Scott Peterson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was born within San Diego, California and obtained the B.A.&nbsp;in Agriculture Business in 1997 from California Polytechnic State University in 1997.&nbsp;He was introduced to Laci in the course of working as waiter during his time at college.</p><p align=justify>When he was arrested, arrest, officers discovered a number of suspect items inside his vehicle such as a shovel two ropes, and the double-edged dagger.</p><p align=justify>Scott Lee Peterson was born October 24, 1972, at Sharp Coronado Hospital in San Diego, California, to Lee Arthur Peterson, a businessman who owned a crate-packaging company, and Jacqueline “Jackie” Helen Latham, who owned a boutique in La Jolla called The Put On. Though Lee and Jackie had six children from previous relationships, Scott was their only child together. As a child, he shared a bedroom with his half-brother John in the family’s two-bedroom apartment in La Jolla. Peterson began playing golf at an early age, a result of time he spent with his father. By age 14, he could beat his father at the game. For a time, he had dreams of becoming a professional golfer like Phil Mickelson, his teammate at the University of San Diego High School. By the end of high school, he was one of the top junior golfers in San Diego. In 1990, Peterson enrolled at Arizona State University (where Mickelson had also enrolled) on a partial golf scholarship. Mickelson would go on to become a highly successful PGA golfer, and Lee Peterson later testified that the considerable competition that Mickelson presented to his son while they were at Arizona State discouraged Peterson. Randall Mell of the Broward County, Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that Chip Couch, the father of another Arizona State golfer, Chris Couch, told Mell that he got Peterson kicked off the golf team. Couch stated that Peterson had taken Chris out drinking and to meet girls, resulting in a hangover for Chris. As Chris was the No. 1 junior in the country, Chip did not want Peterson to threaten his son’s future, and complained to the golf coach, who kicked Peterson off the team. Peterson transferred to Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, and later, California Polytechnic State University. He initially planned to major in international business, but changed his major to agricultural business. Professors who taught Peterson described him as a model student. His agribusiness professor Jim Ahern commented, “I wouldn’t mind having a class full of Scott Petersons.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On December 23, 2002 at 5:45pm, Peterson and Laci went to Salon, Salon—the workplace of Laci’s sister, Amy Rocha—for a monthly scheduled haircut. As they spoke, Rocha said Peterson offered to pick up a fruit basket that she had ordered for her grandfather as the Christmas gift the next day because he would be playing golf at a course nearby. Prosecutors say Peterson also told other people he would play golf on the day of Christmas Eve. Later that evening Sharon Rocha, Laci’s mother, spoke with Laci on the telephone around 8:30 pm.</p><p>Laci soon took a part-time job as a substitute teacher, and Peterson got a job with Tradecorp U.S.A., a newly founded subsidiary of a European fertilizer company. According to Lee Peterson, the Spanish company was trying to establish a customer base in the United States, and hired Peterson as their West Coast representative. Working on salary plus commission, he sold irrigation systems, fertilizer, chemical nutrients, and related products to big farms and flower growers, primarily in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Peterson was earning a salary of $5,000 a month before taxes. Laci’s loved ones, including her mother and younger sister, related that she worked enthusiastically at being the perfect housewife, enjoying cooking and entertaining, and that she and her family welcomed the news in 2002 that she was pregnant. In November 2002, when Laci was seven months pregnant, Peterson was introduced by a friend to a Fresno massage therapist named Amber Frey. In later public statements, Frey said Peterson told her he was single, and the two began a romantic relationship. The last time Peterson’s parents saw Laci was during a three-day weekend they spent together in Carmel, California the week before Christmas.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Scott Peterson height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Scott <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Peterson later told police that he last saw his wife about 9:30&nbsp;a.m. on December 24, when he left to go fishing at the Berkeley Marina. He said Laci was watching a cooking television show but was preparing to mop the floor, bake cookies and walk the family dog to a nearby park. The next morning a female neighbor of the Petersons says she found the Petersons’ dog, a Golden Retriever named McKenzie, and returned him to the Petersons’ back yard. About a half hour later, shortly after 10:45am, another neighbor named Mike Chiavetta said he found McKenzie wandering the neighborhood with a muddy leash, and returned him to the Petersons’ yard. Peterson said he returned home that afternoon to find it empty. Peterson found McKenzie in their back yard, and Laci’s 1996 Land Rover Discovery SE was in the driveway. He showered and washed his clothes because he got wet from fishing.</p><p align=justify>Peterson was arrested on April 18, 2003, near a La Jolla golf course. He claimed that he was meeting his father and brother for a game of golf. His naturally dark brown hair had been dyed blond, and his Mercedes-Benz was “overstuffed” with miscellaneous items, including nearly $15,000 in cash, twelve Viagra tablets, survival gear, camping equipment, several changes of clothes, four cell phones, and his brother’s driver’s license, in addition to his own. Peterson’s father explained that he used his brother’s license the day before to get a San Diego resident discount at the golf course, and that Peterson had been living out of his car because of the media attention. However, police suspected these items were an indication that Peterson planned to flee to Mexico, an idea with which prosecutors would later concur.</p><h2>Who is Scott Peterson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Scott Peterson</strong> married to <strong>Laci Peterson </strong>.

The autopsy on both bodies was performed by forensic pathologist Dr. Brian Peterson (no relation to the Petersons). According to the autopsy, Conner’s skin was not decomposed at all, though the right side of his body was mutilated, and the placenta and umbilical cord were not found with the body. Laci’s cervix was intact. The exact date and cause of Laci’s death were never determined. She had suffered two cracked ribs, though Dr. Peterson could not determine if this occurred before or after her death. Laci’s upper torso had been emptied of internal organs except for the uterus, which protected the fetus, explaining the lower level of decomposition it experienced. Dr. Peterson determined that the fetus had been expelled from Laci’s decaying body, though he could not determine whether it was alive or dead when this occurred.</p><h3>Where is Scott Peterson now?</h3><p>Peterson was in California’s San Quentin State Prison on death row, but since his sentencing was overturned, he was transferred to <b>San Mateo County Jail</b>.</p><h3>What did Scott Peterson do to Laci?</h3><p>In 2004, Scott Peterson was convicted and later sentenced to death for <b>killing his pregnant wife Laci and dumping her body</b> in the San Francisco Bay.
