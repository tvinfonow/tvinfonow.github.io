Olympic sprinter, who was named second-fastest female athlete of all time.&nbsp;At the 2012 London Olympics, she won bronze, silver, gold medals.</p><p>She was able to win multiple medals at 2012 Summer Olympics, similar to&nbsp;Gabby Doug.</p><p>Jeter attended Bishop Montgomery High School. Initially, basketball was the preferred sport in her family, and her younger brother, Eugene, later joined the Sacramento Kings. Her basketball coach suggested that she try out track, and an 11.7-second run confirmed her natural talent for sprinting. Jeter graduated from California State University, Dominguez Hills, which is located in Carson, California, with a bachelor’s degree in physical education. Jeter set the record for most NCAA medals by a CSUDH track athlete and became the university’s first U.S. Olympic Trials qualifier. A recurring hamstring problem kept her out of competition for much of 2003–05, and it was not until 2007 that she made her first impact in senior track and field athletics, having undergone treatment with deep tissue massage.</p><p>In 2007, Jeter won a silver medal in the 60 meters at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships with a personal best of 7.17&nbsp;seconds, and she remained in good form, improving her 100&nbsp;m best to 11.04&nbsp;seconds to take fourth place in the 100&nbsp;m at the Adidas Track Classic. Building upon this, she qualified for her first major competition by finishing third at the national championships behind Torri Edwards and Lauryn Williams. She went on to win the bronze medal at the World Championships in a personal best time of 11.02 seconds, as well as taking the 100&nbsp;m gold at the 2007 World Athletics Final.</p><p align=justify>Eugene is Eugene’s younger brother and he played professionally for Sacramento Kings.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carmelita Jeter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carmelita</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Runner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1979</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Pooh Jeter</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Carmelita Jeter ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Although she set a 100&nbsp;m best of 10.97&nbsp;seconds in the quarter-finals, she did not progress beyond the semifinals, finishing just two hundredths out of the qualifying positions. A sixth-place finish in the 200&nbsp;m meant she had not made the 2008 Summer Olympics team, despite being one of the favourites for selection. She qualified for the 100 and 200&nbsp;m races at the 2008 World Athletics Final, but only managed fourth and fifth place, respectively. She changed coach in November, deciding to work with John Smith, who had previously coached athletes such as Maurice Greene. Smith began completely remodelling Jeter’s running style.</p><h2>Carmelita Jeter Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Carmelita Jeter is one of the <strong>richest Runner</strong> from United States.

Even taking this into account, Jeter surprised with one of the highlights of the final edition of the IAAF World Athletics Final. She won the 100&nbsp;m race in Thessaloniki, Greece with a time of 10.67, to become the third fastest woman in history and set a championship record. This was the fastest run in twelve years; a time which had only been bettered by Marion Jones and Florence Griffith-Joyner, and 0.16&nbsp;seconds faster than Jeter had ever run before. She ran even faster a week later at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, winning in 10.64&nbsp;seconds (the fourth fastest time ever) to become the second fastest woman outright.</p><p>At the 2009 World Athletics Championships, in Berlin, Jeter was one of the favorites for the gold medal as a 10.83-second personal best in the semis made her the fastest qualifier for the final. She ended up with her second World Championship bronze medal in the 100&nbsp;m, however, finishing a tenth of a second behind Fraser and Stewart. The races after the championships proved more successful: she beat strong opposition in the IAAF Golden League meets in Zurich and Brussels with two sub-10.90 runs.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Carmelita Jeter height</b> <strong>5 ft 4 in</strong> Carmelita <strong>weight</strong> <strong>58 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 4 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>58 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>She won the 100 m bronze at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics and a gold at the World Athletics Final. She won a second World Championship bronze. Her victory in the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix in 10.64&nbsp;seconds made her the second-fastest woman ever in the 100&nbsp;m, behind Florence Griffith Joyner’s long-standing world record. Currently she holds three of the top ten times ever run.</p><p align=justify>Her fast times were a double-edged sword in that they brought as much suspicion as they did appreciation. At age 30, Jeter had improved her personal record by over a third of a second within a single season and she ranked between Jones and Griffith-Joyner in the all-time lists. Given the history of the women’s sprints and speculation about performance-enhancing drug use, Jeter said “I can’t be upset about those questions [but] It’s unfortunate that I work this hard and I don’t get the credit I should get”. She improved her 60&nbsp;m best to 7.02&nbsp;seconds to win at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. This was still slower than LaVerne Jones-Ferrette, and Jeter resolved to improve further for the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships.</p><h2>Who is Carmelita Jeter Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Carmelita Jeter</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
