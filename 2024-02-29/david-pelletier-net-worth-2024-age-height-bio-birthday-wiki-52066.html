Who is David Pelletier dating now & how much money does David Pelletier have?</p><h2>David Pelletier Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>David Pelletier</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Figure Skater</strong> who was born on <strong>November 22, 1974</strong> in Sayabec, Quebec, <strong>Canada</strong>. Figure skaters won the Olympic gold medal in 2002’s Salt Lake City games.</p><p>He was awarded gold at the 2002 Olympics and that was that of skier&nbsp;Kelly Clark.</p><p>David Jacques Pelletier (born November 22, 1974) is a Canadian pairs figure skater. With his partner Jamie Salé, he was the co-gold medal winner at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. They shared the gold medal with the Russian pair Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze after the 2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal.</p><p>Pelletier was born in Sayabec, Quebec, and grew up near the hockey rink. His mother said if he wanted to play hockey, he also had to take figure-skating lessons. He achieved early success as a pair skater with Julie Laporte. They won both the novice and junior titles at the Canadian Figure Skating Championships and placed 7th at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 1992. Despite these accomplishments, Pelletier felt his career needed a “shake up” and paired up with Allison Gaylor. They trained in part with Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, and had their biggest success in 1995 when they captured the 1995 Canadian silver medal and represented Canada at the World Figure Skating Championships in Birmingham, England where they placed 15th. That same year, as a single skater, Pelletier placed second in the short program of the men’s event at the Canadian championships. He struggled in the long program, falling to fourth overall.</p><p align=justify>He married his skater&nbsp;Jamie Sale&nbsp;on December 30, 2005 following a proposal to her on Christmas Day of the previous year.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David Pelletier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pelletier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Figure Skater</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sayabec</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Quebec</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jamie Salé</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jesse Joe Pelletier</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>David Pelletier ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, David Pelletier's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update David Pelletier's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>After failing to reach the podium the next two years, Pelletier and Gaylor split and Pelletier paired up with young singles skater Caroline Roy. Just before the 1998 Canadian championships, Pelletier’s former partner Julie Laporte was killed in a car accident. Pelletier and Roy had a strong skate, but placed 6th and split soon after the event.</p><h2>David Pelletier Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>David Pelletier is one of the <strong>richest Figure Skater</strong> from Canada. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>David Pelletier</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a World Junior Figure Skating Champion at age 18.</p><p align=justify>He was inducted into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame and the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame.</p><p align=justify>The pressure for the Olympics was intense. Despite several silvers and bronzes, Canada had only won two gold medals in figure skating, in 1948 and 1960, and it was hoped by many that Salé and Pelletier would do well. They skated a clean short program, only to trip and fall on their closing pose. Because the fall was not on an element, it did not receive a deduction. The pair placed second behind Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze. In the long program, Salé and Pelletier also placed second. A minor jump step out error from Sikharulidze and a clean program from the Canadians had convinced some they had won the gold but when the judges’ scores came up, Salé and Pelletier had been placed second in the long program. Five judges had awarded the long program to Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, and only four to Salé and Pelletier. This result spurred an outcry from the North American media and booing from many audience members, but Salé and Pelletier accepted the silver medal. After the competition, the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne admitted she had been pressured by the head of her federation, Didier Gailhaguet, into awarding the long program to the Russians and a judging controversy quickly blew up. The scandal ultimately resulted in the suspension of several judges and officials. The results of the competition were discarded and Salé and Pelletier were awarded a second set of gold medals in a special ceremony later in the week.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Figure Skater</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the summer of 1999, Gaulthier enlisted the help of Lori Nichol, a Canadian choreographer, to choreograph Salé & Pelletier’s programs for the upcoming season. Nichol created a tango piece for their short program, and, after a suggestion from coach Marijane Stong, set their long program to music from the movie Love Story. The programs got off to a good start. At the 1999 Skate America, Salé & Pelletier won both the short and the long programs, defeating the two-time and reigning world champions, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze. At the Nations Cup, their second Grand Prix event, they finished second. However, at the Grand Prix Final, they made several errors in both programs and finished fifth.</p><p>Salé and Pelletier returned to Lori Nichol for their 2000-01 programs. She choreographed a jazzy short to “Come Rain or Come Shine” and a dramatic, mature long to Wagner’s opera “Tristan und Isolde.” They returned to Skate America and Skate Canada that fall, winning both over Shen/Zhao and Berezhnaya/Sikharulidze, respectively. Berezhnaia/Sikharulidze then narrowly defeated them at Trophée Lalique.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>David Pelletier height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> David <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Pelletier asked coach Richard Gauthier to help him find another partner, and he suggested Salé. They traveled to Edmonton in February 1998 to try out with Salé again. “The first time we grabbed hands, it was just great,” said Pelletier, and by the next month Salé had moved to Montreal to skate with him.</p><p align=justify>Salé and Pelletier again demonstrated early success in the 2001-02 season, winning both Skate America and Skate Canada with their new long program to “Adagio Sostenuto” by Rachmaninoff, nicknamed “Orchid” for its flower theme. Perhaps more importantly, they demonstrated technical consistency in both competitions.</p><h2>Who is David Pelletier Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>David Pelletier</strong> married to <strong>Jamie Salé </strong>.
