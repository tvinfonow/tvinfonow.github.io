Two-time MLB All-Star known as “The D-Train” who was awarded the National League Rookie of the Year award in 2003 , with the Florida Marlins.&nbsp;He also played a role in helping the Marlins win the World Series Championship that same season.</p><p>He played for the Marlins just a few years later than&nbsp;He pitched for the Marlins a few years after <a href=#>Al Leiter</a>..</p><p>Willis was raised by his mother, Joyce, a welder, in Alameda, California. She played in elite-level softball leagues when Willis was a child. Willis never knew his father, Clinton Ostah, who was a minor league player in the 1970s. Growing up, Willis rooted for the Oakland Athletics as a child. Willis’ favorite player was former Oakland Athletics’ pitcher Dave Stewart. Willis attended Encinal High School in Alameda, where he played baseball for four years. In Willis’ senior year in 2000, he had a 0.70 earned run average (ERA) with 111 strikeouts in 70 innings pitched and was named California Player of the Year. He initially committed to play college baseball at Arizona State. He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 8th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft.</p><p>Willis won his 19th game of the season against the Mets on September 2, breaking Carl Pavano’s franchise record for most wins in a season. Pavano held the Marlins’ mark for most victories in a season by a Marlins’ pitcher for a year. On September 7 against the Washington Nationals, Willis pitched 6 innings and allowed 1 earned run, which gave him his 20th win of the season. He became the first African-American pitcher to win 20 games in a season since Dave Stewart did it in 1990, and in the process, he became the first pitcher to win 20 games and have 20 hits as a batter since Mike Hampton did it in 1999 for the Astros. On September 22, Willis became the first pitcher to bat seventh or higher since Montreal’s Steve Renko batted seventh on August 26, 1973. Willis went 1-for-4 against the New York Mets. He would go on to post a 22-10 record with a 2.63 earned run average and 1.13 walks plus hits per innings pitched. His 22 wins was the most in baseball. He also pitched 7 complete games and 5 shutouts, also the most in baseball. Willis is still the only pitcher in Marlins history to win 20 games in a season.</p><p align=justify>His mother was his mother and was a part of his half-brother Walter.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dontrelle Willis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dontrelle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Willis</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1982</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oakland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joyce M.
