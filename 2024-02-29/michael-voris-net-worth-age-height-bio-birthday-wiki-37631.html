According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Michael Voris</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Voris holds that there has been a liberal shift in the Catholic Church, a post-1960s culture that has had a negative influence over Catholics; some of this has been influenced by “Americanism”, a heresy that Pope Leo XIII warned about in the 19th century. The Detroit Free Press reported that Voris holds that “many current church leaders are ‘namby-pamby… It’s all about, ‘Love your neighbor.’ ” What’s needed instead, he said, is “a muscular Catholicism that isn’t afraid to encourage battle and sacrifice.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After being a guest speaker at several Catholic parishes in Detroit and serving as a host on the Michigan Catholic Radio network, in 2006 Voris started the digital television studio St. Michael’s Media in Ferndale, Michigan. Voris’s move into Catholic video broadcasting was in response to the book and film The Da Vinci Code. Voris had planned to make a one-hour TV program in order to refute the image of the Catholic Church put forward by Dan Brown’s work. He came to believe “that the challenges facing the Catholic Church in the United States were much larger and more pernicious than a single blockbuster.”</p><p>Voris withdrew much of his retirement fund, and with volunteers began St. Michael’s Media. With his background in secular broadcasting Voris felt he could provide a level of production that could compete with mainstream talk shows. He began hosting “The One True Faith” in 2006, and began hosting a Catholic talk radio show, “News and Views Weekly”, in 2007. Voris’s work soon received an endorsement from then-Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke of St. Louis. By early 2008 Voris’s programs “expanded into markets from New York to California, from Ontario to the Philippines.” On September 1, 2008, he partnered with RealCatholicTV.com, which is owned by Marc Brammer (who has worked as a business developer for Moody’s and is a member of Opus Dei). Some of the Catholic video segments/programs Voris has worked on include “The Vortex”, “The One True Faith”, “Catholic Investigative Agency”, “The Armor of God”, and “Where Did the Bible Come From?”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Voris height</b> Not available right now.
