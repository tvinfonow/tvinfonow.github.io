She stayed in the role until 1993, during this time also playing Holly’s lookalike half-sister Paloma Perez, a heroic revolutionary. In 1995, Samms appeared as the villainous Grayson Louder in the prime time soap opera Models Inc., a spin-off of Melrose Place, both produced by former Dynasty producer Aaron Spelling. Perhaps there was a hint of Dynasty in the romantic crime drama for TV, Treacherous Beauties. Set on a country horse stud, she played opposite a strong but silent male lead, played by Bruce Greenwood.

On 10 April 1985 Samms appeared in the fifth season episode “Kidnapped” as Fallon Carrington Colby, a role originated by Pamela Sue Martin in 1981. The character was immediately transplanted into the new Dynasty spin-off The Colbys for two seasons (1985–1987), until reintroduced back into Dynasty in the 23 September 1987 eighth season premiere “The Siege – Part 1.” Samms remained with Dynasty for two seasons until its last episode on 11 May 1989.
