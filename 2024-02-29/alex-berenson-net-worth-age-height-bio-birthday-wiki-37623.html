Alex Berenson (born January 6, 1973) is a former reporter for The New York Times and the author of several thriller novels and a book on corporate financial filings. His 2019 book Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence sparked controversy, earning denunciations from many in the scientific and medical communities along with more positive reviews.</p><p>He has written 12 spy novels, all featuring the same protagonist, CIA agent John Wells. His first novel, The Faithful Spy, was released in April 2006 and won an Edgar Award for best first novel by an American author. The Faithful Spy was ranked #1 on The New York Times Bestseller List for paperbacks.</p><p>In 2010, Berenson left the Times to become a full-time novelist. He lives in the Hudson Valley, with his wife, a forensic psychiatrist.</p><p>He authored the controversial 2019 book Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence that has been denounced as alarmist and inaccurate by many in the scientific and medical communities because of his claims that cannabis causes psychosis and violence; many scientists state that he is drawing inappropriate conclusions from the research, primarily by inferring causation from correlation, as well as cherry picking data that fits his narrative, and falling victim to selection bias via his use of anecdotes to back up his assertions. Other reviews have been less critical, accepting the anecdotes as real-life examples of the science presented.</p><p align=justify>In the fall of 2003 and the summer of 2004, Berenson covered the occupation of Iraq for the Times. More recently, he has covered the pharmaceutical and health care industries, specializing in issues concerning dangerous drugs. Beginning in December 2008, Berenson reported on the Bernard Madoff $50 billion Ponzi scheme scandal.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex Berenson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alex</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Friesen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Author</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1973</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alex Berenson ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
