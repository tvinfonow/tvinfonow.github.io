Quarterback who was a part of the NFL between 1998 and 2001 for the Detroit Lions, and from 2002 until 2012 with the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>The latter part of his career as an assistant in the absence of&nbsp;He spent the latter half of his career as a backup to <a href=#>Ben Roethlisberger</a> in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;in Pittsburgh.</p><p>Charlie Batch was the Detroit Lions’ starter through better parts of the 1998–2001 seasons. After the surprising retirement of running back Barry Sanders in 1999, Detroit struggled to find consistency in its running game, and Batch was asked to assume a “hybrid” quarterback role and assist in the Lions’ running game by using various QB sweeps, bootlegs, and QB draws in an attempt to keep defenders off balance. He proved to be effective, but injury prone, in his years with Detroit. In 1999, the year Sanders retired, Batch helped rally Detroit to a surprising wildcard playoff game against the Washington Redskins. Batch did not play in the game, giving way to Gus Frerotte due to injury, and Detroit lost 27–13.</p><p>Batch is the son of Lynne Settles, a former school teacher, and Nilesh Shah, a former Pittsburgh steel mill operator. Batch had a remarkable career at Eastern Michigan University, owning almost every passing record. He also earned a degree in criminal justice. He was a local favorite when he was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 1998 NFL Draft.</p><p align=justify>His birthplace was Homestead, Pennsylvania, not away from where he would spend the majority in the duration of his NFL career.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charlie Batch</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Charlie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Batch</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Homestead</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Nilesh Shah, Lynn Settles</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>LaTasha Wilson-Batch</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Charlie Batch ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Batch was replaced mid-season by Ty Detmer for whom the Cleveland Browns received a fourth round pick, but had already planned to cut him. Detmer immediately came in as a starter only to throw seven interceptions against his former team. Batch was eventually released by the Lions that offseason for stated salary cap reasons. Batch had been deemed expendable due in part to the team’s drafting of Joey Harrington with their first-round pick, and Millen had gone on record in his desire to find a starting quarterback other than Batch earlier that year. Still, Batch passed for over 9,000 yards with Detroit, reaching sixth on the Lions’ all-time list. Ironically, Batch would ultimately last longer in the NFL than Harrington, who would prove to be a draft bust and was out of the NFL by 2009.</p><h2>Charlie Batch Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Charlie Batch is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Charlie Batch</b>'s net worth <strong>$2 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a star player in the NCAA Division I at Eastern Michigan University, which resulted in him being picked in the second round of the 1998 NFL draft.</p><p align=justify>He was the winner of two Super Bowls while he was an alternate for his team, the Steelers: XL in 2006 and XLIII in 2009.</p><p align=justify>Charles D’Donte Batch (born December 5, 1974) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL).

The Schramm-McCracken Prize was bestowed on Charlie Batch in 2002 by the Three Rivers District of the Loyal Order of Moose in large part for his creation and work at the Charlie Batch Urban Pumpkin Patch and Gardens. The CBUPP was a created as a way to help fight hunger, using Urban Agriculture and local gang activity by employing inner city youth in a sustainable, green future.</p><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to a one-year contract for 2002 as a backup, but he did not play. The move to initially sign Batch was not a surprise, given that Batch was from Pittsburgh and the Steelers’ current Director of Football Operations Kevin Colbert initially drafted Batch in Detroit. Despite not playing in 2002 (being third string behind Kordell Stewart and Tommy Maddox, who split the year as the starters), Batch became popular with Steeler fans, partly due to having grown up in nearby Homestead, Pennsylvania but also because of his charity works (see below).</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Charlie Batch height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Charlie <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 2000 season proved to be Batch’s last full season as an NFL starter. He was injured (leaving the Week 17 matchup against Chicago with a shoulder injury) in a pivotal game in which Detroit lost on a last-second field goal by Paul Edinger. The game cost the Lions a playoff berth and set into motion a radical turn of events in the Lions’ front office, resulting in the hiring of Fox Sports color commentator Matt Millen as the new CEO and general manager. Millen’s arrival ultimately resulted in an extreme makeover in Detroit’s roster, and Batch became one of the more visible casualties.</p><p align=justify>In 2006, Batch was presented with the first Jerome Bettis Award for Humanity and Community Service for his work supporting children through his Best of the Batch Foundation and for efforts to upgrade local football fields and basketball courts for area kids. This annual award is presented to a Pittsburgh individual who demonstrates the image of the award title. Batch was chosen because of his commitment to his hometown of Homestead, Pennsylvania, by bringing to the area programs for the children through his Best of the Batch Foundation and upgrading basketball courts and football fields for the kids to use.</p><h2>Who is Charlie Batch Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Charlie Batch</strong> married to <strong>LaTasha Wilson-Batch</strong>.
