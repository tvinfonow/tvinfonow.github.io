Seven victims were allegedly targeted for they were the Baton Rouge Serial Killer.</p><p>He hails in the exact same place as the famous jazz musician&nbsp;Louis Armstrong.</p><p>Lee entered the St. Martin Parish home of Dianne Alexander on July 9, 2002. Lee beat Alexander severely and attempted to rape her. Dianne Alexander is the only known survivor of Derrick Todd Lee. Alexander survived because her son walked in during the commission of the crime, frightening Lee out of the back of the house. Alexander’s son chased Lee through the back of the house and was able to get a description of the car. Alexander had details as to what Lee looked like and on May 22, 2003, Alexander was able to describe Lee to a police sketch artist.</p><p>As a result of an inaccurate FBI offender profile and erroneous eyewitness accounts, police originally believed the killer to be white. Police therefore administered thousands of DNA tests to Caucasian men in and around the general area of the murders. Having no leads, police then allowed the now defunct company DNAPrint Genomics to access DNA left at the crime scenes. DNAPrint Genomics generated an ancestry profile indicating that the suspect was 85% African, thus changing the course of the investigation. Police then knew they were searching for a black man for the January 2002 slaying of Geralyn Barr DeSoto. More specific analysis of the DNA evidence found under the fingernails of DeSoto linked Lee to the 21-year-old Addis, Louisiana woman’s death.</p><p align=justify>He was married to an estranged spouse, Jacqueline, at the time of the murders.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Derrick Todd Lee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Derrick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1968</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>St. Francisville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Louisiana</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Florence Lee, Samuel Ruth</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Dedrick Lee, Dorris Lee, Derrick Todd Lee, Jr.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Derrick Todd Lee ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
