Antoinette Renee Frank (born April 30 1971) is an ex- New Orleans police officer who in March of 1995 was involved in an assault with a gun at an establishment that led to the deaths of two family members who managed the establishment as well as the fellow New Orleans Police Department officer Ronald A.

Bryant thought that the officer was making a traffic stop, but as he got closer he saw the officer and two black men fighting on the side of the road. At that time Wallace broke away, ran and picked up a TEC-9 semi-automatic weapon off the grass. Bryant ordered Wallace to drop the gun, which he did immediately and was restrained; Lacaze then lunged towards Wallace but Bryant grabbed him. Frank informed him that Lacaze was with her and ordered him released. Despite his involvement in the altercation, Bryant was never questioned by police and he never gave a formal statement.</p><p>Two men who claimed they met Lacaze at a party on February 4, 1995, John Stevens and Anthony Wallace, testified in court. As the two were leaving the party, a verbal altercation between Stevens and Lacaze ensued, but Wallace suggested that they leave. The two men got in a car and drove several blocks until a police vehicle pulled the car over. Frank, in police uniform, exited the squad car and told both Wallace and Stevens to get out and go to the back of the car. At that point Wallace saw Lacaze, and noticed that he was holding a gun. According to Stevens, Wallace then rushed Lacaze and the two men began fighting, then both Stevens and Frank also jumped in the fray and the weapon discharged. Stevens began running, but another man appeared and grabbed both Lacaze and Wallace. Frank then told the man that “Lacaze was the good guy” and that Wallace was the one causing the problems. Wallace was restrained until a back-up unit arrived on the scene, when he was subsequently arrested and charged with attempted murder and armed robbery.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Antoinette Frank height</b> Not available right now.

Their trials were severed, and Lacaze was tried first on July 17–21, 1995 before Judge Frank Marullo. He was found guilty as charged, and sentenced to death. His main error had been using Williams’ Chevron credit card at a Chevron station in Gretna just minutes after the robbery and murder.</p><p align=justify>On October 18, 2006, Frank’s lawyers argued before the Louisiana Supreme Court that her death sentence should be overturned because she was denied state-funded experts to help prepare for the sentencing phase of the trial. They argued that the defense needed to conduct “an investigation into the defendant’s background for possible mitigating evidence.” Frank’s attorneys introduced the testimony of psychiatrists who said that possible traumatic events in Frank’s childhood could have affected her behavior at the time of the murders and she may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. A psychiatrist retained by the state disagreed that Frank showed symptoms of trauma; he agreed with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial tendencies given to Frank by doctors at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women. On May 22, 2007, the state Louisiana Supreme Court ruled 5–2 that the death penalty should be upheld.</p><h2>Who is Antoinette Frank Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Antoinette Frank</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
