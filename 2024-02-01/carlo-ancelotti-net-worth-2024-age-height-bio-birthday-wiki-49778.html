After previously managing Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Milan between 2001 and 2009, European soccer coach who was promoted to manager at FC Bayern Munich Munich in 2016.</p><p>While managing Chelsea, he coached English striker&nbsp;He coached English striker <a href=#>Daniel Sturridge</a> while managing Chelsea..</p><p>Ancelotti began his career in 1974 with Parma. He made his professional debut in Serie C during the 1976–77 season, at the age of 18. Under manager Cesare Maldini, he was often deployed behind the forwards, or as a second striker, due to his eye for goal. Ancelotti excelled in this role and helped Parma to a second place in the Serie C1 girone A during the 1978–79 season, which qualified the team for the Serie B play-offs. In the decisive match in Vicenza, against Triestina, with the score tied at 1–1, he scored two goals, which gave Parma a 3–1 victory and sealed their place in Serie B the following season.</p><p>After attracting strong interest from Inter Milan, in mid-1979, Ancelotti transferred to Roma, and made his Serie A debut in a 0–0 draw against Milan on 16 September. Under manager Nils Liedholm, he was deployed as a winger or central midfielder and became one of the club’s most important players in a team which featured the likes of Brazilian star midfielders Falcão and Toninho Cerezo, as well as Italian footballers Roberto Pruzzo, Bruno Conti, Agostino Di Bartolomei, and Pietro Vierchowod, immediately winning consecutive Coppa Italia titles in his first two seasons with the club. During his eight seasons at the club, he won the Coppa Italia a total of four times (1980, 1981, 1984, and 1986). After struggling with knee injuries, and managing second- and third-place league finishes in 1981 and 1982, Ancelotti helped lead the team to win a historic Italian championship in 1983, the club’s second ever league title in their history. The following season, he even helped Roma to win another Coppa Italia title and reach the European Cup final in 1984, although missed the final through injury as Roma were defeated by Liverpool on penalties at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. He was named the team’s captain in 1985 under new club manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, and served as a mentor to the young midfielder Giuseppe Giannini, as Roma won the Coppa Italia, but once again narrowly missed out on the league title during the 1985–86 Serie A season, finishing in second place behind Juventus.</p><p align=justify>Davide, his son, also became a professional soccer star.&nbsp;Mariann Barrena Mclay, his wife, gave birth to Katia in 2014.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carlo Ancelotti</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carlo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ancelotti</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reggiolo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Emilia-Romagna</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Italy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Giuseppe Ancelotti</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Mariann Barrena McClay , Luisa Ancelotti</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Davide Ancelotti, Katia Ancelotti</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Carlo Ancelotti ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
