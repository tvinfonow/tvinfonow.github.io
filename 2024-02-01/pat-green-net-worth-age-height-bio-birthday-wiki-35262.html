He achieved some critical and popular success but was unable to match his prior success and earned a “sellout” label. In late 2004, “Lucky Ones” was Green’s 3rd and final CD release on the Universal/Republic label. Despite weak label support, the album peaked at number 6 on the U.S. Country charts. Green joined popular country music artists including Keith Urban, Gretchen Wilson, Dave Matthews Band, and Kenny Chesney on major tours. Green released his album Cannonball in 2006. CMT questioned the album as reaching for the “uninspired pop sound of today’s Nashville,” with songs “starting to sound too much alike” and “crossing the line into Nashville pop” and perhaps not “honest and natural.” Green acknowledged that he needed hits to sustain the career that he wanted. In 2008, Green released “Let Me”, as the first single from what would become his final label-released album, What I’m For. The single reached 12 on the country charts, giving Green his first Top 20 single since “Feels Just Like It Should” reached No.&nbsp;13 in 2006. Initially, “Country Star” was released as the second single, but it was withdrawn shortly after the title track (“What I’m For”) began receiving airplay. “Country Star” peaked at 32, and “What I’m For” peaked at 28 on the country charts in July 2009. Green parted ways with BNA shortly afterward.</p><h2>Pat Green Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Pat Green is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States.

The album was released to acclaim in 2001. The adventurous, Beatles-influenced “Wave on Wave”, was released in 2003, with the title track reaching number 3 on the charts by the end of the year. The album featured pop flourishes and sound engineering that was incrementally more compressed than that of “Three Days” but dramatically more so than that of his independent releases. The Christian-tinged title track remains Green’s top career hit.</p><p>Washing out of the industry in 2011, Green announced his return to Texas and independent music.
