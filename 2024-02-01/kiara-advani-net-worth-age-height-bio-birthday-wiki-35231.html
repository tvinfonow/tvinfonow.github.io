Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said: “Kiara Advani catches you completely unaware” and has the “combination of looks and talent”, whereas Mehul S Thakkar of Deccan Chronicle noted her performance as being “very striking” and said she “shows a lot of promise”.

Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016), about the life of MS Dhoni, an Indian cricketer who was the former captain of the Indian cricket team.

Her next appearance was in Sandeep Vanga’s romantic drama Kabir Singh alongside Shahid Kapoor. An adaptation of Vanga’s 2017 Telugu movie Arjun Reddy, it is about the titular character (played by Kapoor) who goes on a self-destructive path and becomes an alcoholic surgeon after his lover (played by Advani) marries someone else. Critics responded negatively to the film’s depiction of misogyny and toxic masculinity. Her final role that year was in Raj Mehta’s comedy film Good Newwz, about two couples tryst with in vitro fertilization. Reviewing the film for Mint, Udita Jhunjunwala found her to be “endearing as the god-fearing expectant mother-to-be”.

Born as Alia Advani, Advani changed her first name to Kiara prior to the release of her first film, Fugly. Kiara was quoted as saying that it was Salman Khan’s suggestion to change her name from Alia to Kiara, as Alia (Bhatt) was already up and coming at the time. In an interview to Filmfare in 2019, Kiara Advani said that the name “Kiara” was inspired from Priyanka Chopra’s character of Kiara in the film Anjaana Anjaani. The elder of two siblings, Advani has a younger brother, Mishaal. She is also related to several celebrities via her maternal family. Actors Ashok Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey are her step-great-grandfather and great-uncle, respectively, whereas model Shaheen Jaffrey is her aunt.</p><p>In 2020, Advani starred in Guilty, a Netflix thriller film about sexual assault. Ektaa Malik of The Indian Express considered the film to be a “lost opportunity” and added that Advani’s character had been “reduced to the ‘tortured-artistic-creative’ types” while Rohan Naahar of Hindustan Times wrote, “Kiara delivers an absolutely electric performance as the unreliable Nanki, a fiery college student with a fondness for Faiz.” She will next star opposite Akshay Kumar in Laxmmi Bomb, a remake of Tamil film Muni 2: Kanchana, after which she will play the title role in the coming-of-age film Indoo Ki Jawani, co-starring Aditya Seal.

Writing for NDTV, Raja Sen found her to be “positively lovely” in it. She next made her debut in Telugu cinema with Koratala Siva’s political drama Bharat Ane Nenu, which is about a student (played by Mahesh Babu) who unexpectedly becomes the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. Janani K of India Today opined that she “shines in her brief role” but added that her character was “more of an eye-candy who doesn’t add any purpose to the story”. The film had worldwide earnings of ₹ 2.25 billion (US$32&nbsp;million), making it one of Telugu cinema’s highest grossers.
