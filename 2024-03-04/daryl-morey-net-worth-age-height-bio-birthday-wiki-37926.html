A sports executive is primarily acknowledged for his role as director of operations for the Houston Rockets NBA franchise.&nbsp;He is acknowledged to have created the real shooting percentage.</p><p>Both Harden as well as&nbsp;Both he and <a href=#>James Harden</a> were affiliated with the Houston Rockets.&nbsp;were part of The Houston Rockets.</p><p>Daryl Morey (born September 14, 1972) is an American sports executive who is the general manager of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is a strong proponent of analytical methods, having created the true shooting percentage statistic, and co-founded the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. Morey’s basketball philosophy, heavily reliant on analytics, favors three-point field goals and lay-ups over mid-range jumpers. This style has been dubbed “Moreyball”, as a nod towards Michael Lewis’s Moneyball.</p><p>Then-Houston Rockets’ owner Leslie Alexander named Morey assistant general manager of the Houston Rockets on April 3, 2006. He succeeded Carroll Dawson as general manager on May 10, 2007. His hiring followed the Moneyball trend of employing more advanced statistical-based analysis in addition to the traditional use of qualitative scouting and basic statistics. Several teams have hired executives with non-traditional basketball backgrounds, but the Houston Rockets were the first NBA team to hire such a general manager. In the fall of 2012, he and the Rockets acquired now-All-Star and 2017-18 league MVP James Harden via trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder. During Morey’s tenure, the Rockets have not had a losing record and have advanced to the playoffs 9 times, including to the Western Conference Finals in 2015 and 2018. He was also named the NBA Executive of the Year in 2018.</p><p align=justify>His wife was Ellen Morey.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daryl Morey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daryl</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Morey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Business Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baraboo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wisconsin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ellen Morey</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Karen Morey</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Daryl Morey ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Author of Moneyball, Michael Lewis, chose Daryl Morey as the new nerd-hero at the center of his 2016 book, The Undoing Project. Whereas Moneyball highlighted the plight and success of Billy Beane as GM of the Oakland Athletics in 2003, The Undoing Project reveals Daryl Morey as the underdog king of basketball, making use of a similar analytical method to acquire undervalued talent as Beane did with the A’s to produce a forceful team. Lewis uses Morey as a real-world example of one who has exemplified ideas introduced by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two Israeli psychologists whose work pioneered the field of behavioral economics. The psychologist duo defined a simple, two-part distinction of the way the brain makes decisions: System 1 and System 2. A more intuitive, subjective, fast, and efficient process, System 1 represents the brain’s capacity to make split-second choices, often using personal experience to guide decision-making. System 2, however, characterizes a slower, more analytical process of reasoning to reach a conclusion. Michael Lewis points out in The Undoing Project how Daryl Morey observed basketball experts of the time making awfully subjective assessments in looking at basketball players. Shifting the Rockets’ scouting strategy to look at hard data over simple observations, Morey implemented a more System-2-based approach to the team’s hiring practices. This strategy is thought to be critically linked to the Houston Rockets’ recent success.</p><h2>Daryl Morey Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Daryl Morey is one of the <strong>richest Business Executive</strong> from United States.

He is also an avid Esports supporter, has attended MLG (Major League Gaming) events, and is part owner of Clutch Gaming, the Houston, Texas based League of Legends Championship Series eSports team. Morey is also passionate about musical theater. He commissioned and produced the basketball themed musical Small Ball, which opened in April 2018 at the Catastrophic Theater in Houston, Texas.</p><p>On October 4, 2019, Morey tweeted in support of the 2019 Hong Kong protests, drawing criticism from Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, who said that while Morey was the best general manager in the NBA, the Rockets were not a political organization. Morey later deleted the tweet. In mainland China, where the Rockets have an extensive relationship after the selection of Yao Ming in 2002, Morey’s tweet resulted in the Chinese Basketball Association’s suspension of its relationship with the Rockets and the issuance of a statement of dissatisfaction from the consulate office of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in Houston. All Houston Rockets-related items were removed from the Tmall and JD.com sites and the team’s games would no longer broadcast on Tencent. The Associated Press said that the reactions underscored Beijing’s sensitivity about foreign attitudes toward the protests. At the time of the tweet, Morey and the Rockets were in Tokyo for the NBA’s Japan Games. He remained isolated in his room at the hotel and only engaged with Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri upon the fallout. According to Ujiri, Morey claimed that the timing of his tweet was in response to a new law in Hong Kong prohibiting protesters from wearing masks and that himself and his friends had discussed political autonomy in Hong Kong since attending MIT Sloan.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Daryl Morey height</b> Not available right now.
