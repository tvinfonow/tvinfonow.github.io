Their Israeli-born father Mordechai (“Moti”) and their mother Donna were both musical; though he had been a professional soccer player in Israel, Moti also played drums, while Donna won a contest on The Gong Show in the 1970s singing a Bonnie Raitt song. While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second hand Fender for $50. The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents’ 1970s classic rock and Americana records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar. The group played typical wedding band material, including the Beatles’ “Get Back”, Billy Joel’s “You May Be Right” and Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl”, but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches, schools and hospitals.</p><p>Danielle and Este were members of the pop-rock group the Valli Girls, and appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

According to Metro, their music sounds like folk-rock “with a few R&B/hip-hop stylings thrown in for good measure”. The group are fans of, and have been influenced by Beyoncé, covering her song “XO” on BBC Radio 1’s “Live Lounge”, and described “My Song 5” as “ripping off” Timbaland.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After graduating from high school, Danielle was spotted by musician Jenny Lewis at a jam session in Laurel Canyon, which led to Danielle joining Lewis’ touring band. The Strokes’ singer Julian Casablancas came to see one of Lewis’s shows on tour, and he in turn asked Danielle to play guitar and percussion on his solo tour. Danielle rehearsed with Casablancas’ band every day for two months, which she later described as “an eye-opening experience.” Following working with Casablancas from late 2009 to mid 2010, she auditioned for a place in Scarlet Fever, the all-female backing band for CeeLo Green. Danielle performed only once with the group, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.</p><p>For the next five years, Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career, because all three sisters were busy with other projects.

The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, began performing with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005. They released a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name, but left the group shortly after an appearance at the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards.

They laid waste, too, to a herd of ghastly old hobby horses about guitar bands being unmarketable and record sales only being tied to women’s state of undress.” The Independent was more ambivalent about the band, saying there was “an insubstantiality at their core” of their music, as they “plug[ged] unashamedly” into the heritage of acts such as Fleetwood Mac and The Bangles, ultimately finding Haim as “Okay, but not much more”.</p><h3>Is Danielle Haim single?</h3><p>Personal life.
