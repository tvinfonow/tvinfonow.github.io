According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Liam Neeson</b>'s net worth <strong>$145 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>At nine years old, he began boxing training and became an Ulster senior amateur boxing champion.&nbsp;He enrolled at Queen’s University Belfast to study Physics.</p><p align=justify>He was critical of his role in Schindler’s List in the United States.&nbsp;He was made a U.S. citizen in 2009.</p><p align=justify>Liam John Neeson was born in Ballymena on 7 June 1952, the son of Katherine “Kitty” Neeson (née Brown), a cook, and Bernard “Barney” Neeson, a caretaker at the Ballymena Boys All Saints Primary School. Raised Roman Catholic, he was named Liam after the local priest. The third of four siblings, he has three sisters: Elizabeth, Bernadette, and Rosaleen. Neeson said growing up as a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant town made him cautious, and once said he felt like a “second-class” citizen there, but has also said he was never made to feel “inferior or even different” at the town’s predominantly Protestant technical college. Neeson has described himself as out of touch with the politics and history of Northern Ireland until becoming aware of protests by fellow students after Bloody Sunday in 1972, during the Troubles. That experience encouraged him to learn more local history. In a 2009 interview, Neeson said, “I never stop thinking about it [the Troubles]. I’ve known guys and girls who have been perpetrators of violence and victims. Protestants and Catholics. It’s part of my DNA.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$145 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1980, filmmaker John Boorman saw him on stage as Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men and offered him the role of Sir Gawain in the Arthurian film Excalibur.

Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Warren Beatty all expressed interest in portraying Schindler, (the last auditioning), but Neeson was cast in December 1992 after formally auditioning for the role. Neeson read the Keneally book and concluded that his character “enjoyed fookin’ [sic] with the Nazis. In Keneally’s book, it says he was regarded as a kind of a buffoon by them… if the Nazis were New Yorkers, he was from Arkansas. They don’t quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.” His critically acclaimed performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar, and helped the film earn Best Picture of 1993. (The best actor award went to Tom Hanks for his performance in Philadelphia.) Neeson also garnered BAFTA and Golden Globes nominations for his performance as Schindler. Soon after these accolades, Neeson became an in-demand leading actor. He starred in the subsequent period pieces Rob Roy (1995) and Michael Collins (1996), the latter earning him a win for Best Starring Role at the Venice Film Festival and another Golden Globe nomination. He went on to star as Jean Valjean in the 1998 adaptation of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables and in The Haunting (1999) as Dr. David Marrow.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Liam Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actor</strong>.
