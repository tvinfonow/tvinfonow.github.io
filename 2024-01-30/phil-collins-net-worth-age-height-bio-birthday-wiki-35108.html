Collins recognised Charisma Records owner Tony Stratton-Smith’s name in the advert; he and Caryl decided to audition for the roles. The audition took place at the home of the parents of singer Peter Gabriel in Chobham, Surrey. They arrived early; Collins took a swim in the pool and memorised the pieces before his audition. He recalled: “They put on Trespass, and my initial impression was of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies, and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash.” Collins was successful and joined the group in August 1970. The group then took a two-week holiday, during which Collins earned money as an exterior decorator. Mike Rutherford thought Caryl was not a good fit; the group enlisted Steve Hackett in 1971.</p><p>Born and raised in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. Collins began a solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing a series of successful albums, including Face Value (1981), No Jacket Required (1985), and …But Seriously (1989). Collins became “one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the ’80s and beyond”. He also became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. In 1996, Collins left Genesis to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney’s Tarzan (1999) for which he received an Oscar for Best Original Song for “You’ll Be in My Heart”. He rejoined Genesis for their Turn It On Again Tour in 2007. Following a five-year retirement to focus on his family life, Collins released an autobiography in 2016 and completed his Not Dead Yet Tour in 2019.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Phil Collins height</b> <strong>5 feet 6 inches</strong> Phil <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 6 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite the beginnings of an acting career, Collins never intended to pursue it professionally and gravitated towards music which his father was less enthusiastic about. In 1969, he performed in John Walker’s backing band for a European tour, which also consisted of Ronnie Caryl and Gordon Smith on guitar and Brian Chatton on keyboards. After the tour the four stayed together and became the rock band Hickory, which they later renamed Flaming Youth. They recorded one album, Ark 2 (1969), a concept album influenced by the media interest in the 1969 moon landing and features each member sharing lead vocals. After a series of gigs, the group split in early 1970. By this time, Collins had played in the Cliff Charles Blues Band, auditioned for Vinegar Joe and Manfred Mann Chapter Three, and played percussion on “Art of Dying” by George Harrison for his album All Things Must Pass (1970). Harrison acknowledged Collins’s contribution in the remastered edition released in 2000.</p><p align=justify>In 1975, Collins sang and played drums, vibraphone and percussion on Hackett’s first solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte; performed on Eno’s albums Another Green World, Before and After Science, and Music for Films; and replaced drummer Phil Spinelli of the jazz fusion group Brand X before recording their 1976 debut album, Unorthodox Behaviour. His time with Brand X gave Collins his first opportunity to use a drum machine and a home 8-track tape machine. He sang on Anthony Phillips’ solo album The Geese & the Ghost, and the second Brand X album, Moroccan Roll.</p><h2>Who is Phil Collins Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Phil Collins</strong> married to <strong>Orianne Cevey , Jill Tavelman , Andrea Bertorelli </strong>.
