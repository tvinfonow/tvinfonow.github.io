Bollywood actor who received Best Actor and Best Film nominations for his performance in 2009’s movie Love Aaj Kal.&nbsp;The film he made his debut, Parampara, led to his leading role as a lead actor in Main Khiladi Tu Anari and Dil Chahta Hai.</p><p>He co-starred in 2004’s romance film Hum Tum with&nbsp;He co-starred in the 2004 romantic comedy Hum Tum with <a href=#>Rani Mukerji</a>..</p><p>Saif Ali Khan (pronounced&nbsp;[ˈsɛːf əˈli ˈxaːn] ; born Sajid Ali Khan on 16 August 1970) is an Indian film actor and producer. The son of actress Sharmila Tagore and cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, Khan made his acting debut in Yash Chopra’s drama Parampara (1993), but achieved success with his roles in the romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari (both 1994). Khan’s career prospect declined through much of the 1990s, and his biggest commercial success of the decade came with the ensemble drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). He rose to prominence with roles in two ensemble comedy-dramas—Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003).</p><p>One of the highest-paid actors in Bollywood, Khan is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in India. He is known to commit heavily to each role and believes in “staying on a sharp learning curve”. Analysing his career, the journalist Shomini Sen noted that “[t]he actor was part of some major films in the early 1990s […] yet critics wrote him of[f] due to lack of a screen presence and poor dialogue delivery.” Critics noted that Dil Chahta Hai marked a major turning point for Khan, and credited him for pioneering a movement in actors being part of “a new genre of films which was more urban”; film historian Nasreen Munni Kabir stated that the film helped him find “his own style, combining great comic timing and a natural personality.” Sen further explained that “his anglicized upbringing, which initially was a hindrance to his career, became his strongest point.” Following his portrayal of a variety of character types in Ek Hasina Thi (2004), Parineeta (2005), Being Cyrus and Omkara (both 2006), Khan was noted for his versatility; India Today attributed his roles in these films to the establishment of a new image for leading actors in Bollywood, and The Tribune published that Khan had successfully “matured, both as an actor of substance and as a bankable star.</p><p align=justify>His father was a the former captain of cricket Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi.&nbsp;He was married to actor&nbsp;Amrita Singh&nbsp;in 1991, and following their divorce, he got married to the actress&nbsp;Kareena Kapoor&nbsp;in 2012.&nbsp;In his first marriage, there was a son named&nbsp;Ibrahim&nbsp;as well as one daughter, called&nbsp;Sara.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Saif Ali</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Saif</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ali</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Delhi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Delhi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kareena Kapoor , Amrita Singh</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sara Ali Khan, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Ibrahim Ali Khan</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Saif Ali ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

From 1952–71, Pataudi held the title of Nawab of Pataudi, but following his death a pagri ceremony was held in the village of Pataudi, Haryana to crown Khan as the tenth Nawab of Pataudi. Khan has two younger sisters, Saba and actress Soha Ali Khan, and is the paternal grandson of Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi who played for the Indian cricket team in England in 1946. Khan is of predominantly Bengali descent on his mother’s side, and on his father’s side he is of Pashtun descent.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Following an appearance in the moderately successful drama Imtihaan (1994), Khan starred in and earned public recognition with his next two releases opposite Akshay Kumar: Yash Raj Films’ hit romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari. Yeh Dillagi was an unofficial remake of the 1954 Hollywood film Sabrina, and narrated the story of a chauffeur’s daughter (played by Kajol) who becomes a model and engages in a love triangle between two brothers (played by Kumar and Khan). Main Khiladi Tu Anari (the second film in the Khiladi series) featured Khan as an aspiring actor and emerged as the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of both films proved a breakthrough for Khan, and his performance in Main Khiladi Tu Anari fetched him his first Best Supporting Actor nomination at the annual Filmfare Awards. Khan found no success in his next two releases of the year: the dramas Yaar Gaddar and Aao Pyaar Karen, and his career prospect declined through much of the 1990s. All nine films in which he starred—Surakshaa (1995), Ek Tha Raja (1996), Bambai Ka Babu (1996), Tu Chor Main Sipahi (1996), Dil Tera Diwana (1996), Hamesha (1997), Udaan (1997), Keemat: They Are Back (1998) and Humse Badhkar Kaun (1998)—were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Critics generally perceived at this time that his career was over.</p><p>After four consecutive years of poorly received films, Khan’s career prospects began to improve in 1999; he appeared in four films: Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan, Kachche Dhaage, Aarzoo and Hum Saath-Saath Hain. The romantic comedy Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan (alongside Twinkle Khanna) and the romance Aarzoo (alongside Madhuri Dixit and Akshay Kumar) earned little at the box office, but the action-thriller Kachche Dhaage (a story about two estranged brothers becoming the target of a terrorist conspiracy) was Khan’s first commercial success since Main Khiladi Tu Anari. Directed by Milan Luthria, the film was generally well received but critics noted that Khan was overshadowed by co-actor Ajay Devgn. The feature, however, earned Khan a Best Supporting Actor nomination at Filmfare. Khan described his final release of the year, the Sooraj Barjatya-directed family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain, as a “morale-booster”. The film featured an ensemble cast (Mohnish Behl, Salman Khan, Tabu, Karisma Kapoor and Sonali Bendre) and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, earning over ₹ 800 million (US$11&nbsp;million) worldwide. During the filming of Hum Saath-Saath Hain, Khan was charged with poaching two blackbucks in Kankani along with co-stars Salman, Tabu, Bendre and Neelam Kothari. That year, he also appeared briefly in the David Dhawan-directed comedy Biwi No.1, a box office hit.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Saif Ali height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Saif <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1991, Khan was cast as the male lead in Rahul Rawail’s romantic drama Bekhudi (1992) alongside debutante Kajol, but after completing the first shooting schedule of the film, he was considered to be unprofessional by Rawail and was replaced by Kamal Sadanah. While filming Bekhudi, Khan met actress Amrita Singh whom he married in October 1991. Singh gave birth to their daughter (Sara Ali Khan) and son (Ibrahim) in 1995 and 2001 respectively, and the couple later separated in 2004. In 1993, Khan made his acting debut with Parampara, a drama directed by Yash Chopra. The film, which tells the story of two estranged brothers (played by Aamir Khan and Khan), failed to find a wide audience. He next appeared opposite Mamta Kulkarni and Shilpa Shirodkar in the box office flops Aashiq Awara and Pehchaan (both 1993) respectively, but Khan earned the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut for his performance in Aashiq Awara at the 39th Filmfare Awards.</p><p align=justify>Following an appearance in two poorly received films: Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein (2001) and Na Tum Jaano Na Hum (2002), Khan played a photographer in the second chapter (“No Smoking”) of Prawaal Raman’s anthology ensemble thriller Darna Mana Hai (2003). The film failed to find a wide audience and earned little at the box office. Bollywood Hungama described his next film, the Nikhil Advani-directed romantic drama Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), as a “landmark” in his career. Set in New York City, it was written by Karan Johar and co-starred Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta. With a worldwide revenue of over ₹ 860 million (US$12&nbsp;million), the film was received favourably by critics, and became India’s second-biggest hit of the year. It also did well internationally and became the highest-grossing film of the year overseas. Khan was cast in the role of Rohit Patel—a carefree young man who falls in love with Zinta’s character—after Advani had seen his performance in Dil Chahta Hai. Writing for Outlook, Komal Nahta described Khan as a “natural” and “extremely endearing”, and Ram Kamal Mukherjee from Stardust opined that he was successful in displaying “a gamut of emotions.” Khan garnered several awards for his performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and expressed gratitude to Shah Rukh for teaching “me so much—mainly the responsibility of the main lead”. He explained that the film’s success led to Yash Raj Films casting him in the 2004 romantic comedy Hum Tum. At the end of the year, he appeared briefly as Cpt. Anuj Nayyar in J. P. Dutta’s box office flop LOC Kargil.</p><h2>Who is Saif Ali Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Saif Ali</strong> married to <strong>Kareena Kapoor , Amrita Singh </strong>.

Co-starring alongside Preity Zinta and Chandrachur Singh, Khan compared the portrayal of his character with his own evolving maturity as a father. The film addressed themes of single parenthood and teenage pregnancy and emerged a sleeper hit. The Indian Express believed that Khan “looks debauched enough to be the rogue he plays. He is the only dark aspect in a film that is sunny and bright even at its most tragic.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Saif Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Actor</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in India</strong>. Saif Ali celebrates birthday on August 16 of every year.</p><p align=justify>In 2001, Khan appeared in Eeshwar Nivas’ box office flop Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega, (a film loosely inspired by the 1996 black comedy Fargo) following which he featured alongside Aamir Khan and Akshaye Khanna in Farhan Akhtar’s coming-of-age dramedy Dil Chahta Hai. Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends. Khan played Sameer Mulchandani, a “hopeless romantic”, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of his character. Dil Chahta Hai was popular with critics and earned the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi; it performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle it presented. The feature marked a significant turning point in Khan’s career, earning him the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role and awards for Best Supporting Actor at the Screen, Zee Cine and International Indian Academy (IIFA) ceremonies.
