Speaking about the rumours in 2004, March said:</p><p>The suggestion that I’d slept with Tony Leung on set was a disgusting allegation. Jean-Jacques Annaud had a lot to do with that – he was trying to promote the film. … I felt exploited by him. He never dispelled the rumours. He would walk into a room and be ambiguous, which ignited the fire. Everywhere I went in the world, the rumour followed me.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jane March height</b> Not available right now.

The script was the first March had received since The Lover. She later said, “I didn’t like the script at all, but it was a Bruce Willis film and I wasn’t going to turn it down”. March also had reservations about the nudity required by the part: she planned to require the filmmakers to alter some nude scenes, but she eventually did not do so because her working experience on the film was very happy. She went on saying, “I wasn’t at all comfortable with the nudity in Color of Night. … At least in The Lover the scenes were relevant to the script. In Color of Night they were just gratuitous.” Color of Night became a box office failure, but the film went on doing very well in the home video market and became one of the top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995, Maxim magazine also ranked her sex scene in the film as “the Best Sex Scene in film history”.</p><h2>Who is Jane March Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jane March</strong> married to <strong>Carmine Zozzora </strong>.
