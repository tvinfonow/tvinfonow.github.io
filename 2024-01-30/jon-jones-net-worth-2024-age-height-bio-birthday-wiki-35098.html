Despite dominating the fight, Jones was disqualified for the use of multiple 12-6 elbows. The Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts prohibited downward elbow strikes, and Jones was initially only penalized a point from the round. However, because Hamill could not continue due to a dislocated shoulder, Jones was disqualified for those strikes. Consequently, the replay simulation was reviewed, and showed that Jones’s elbows further damaged Hamill’s already bloody and lacerated nose. This marked the first time that Nevada has used its recently enacted instant replay rule, in which the referee’s decision was supported by the commission, which utilized a slow-motion replay to review the elbows. UFC president Dana White was aggrieved that referee Steve Mazagatti ruled the bout as a loss for Jones, saying that it should have been a no contest. In 2019, White said he was still attempting to have the result overturned to a no contest by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.</p><h2>Jon Jones Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jon Jones is one of the <strong>richest MMA Fighter</strong> from United States.
