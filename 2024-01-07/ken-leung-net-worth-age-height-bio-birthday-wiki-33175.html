Actor who most notably played Miles Straume on the popular ABC series Lost, and also appeared in major films like Rush Hour and Vanilla Sky.</p><p>He worked on Rush Hour, Red Dragon, and several other films with director <a href=#>Brett Ratner</a>.</p><p>In 1997, Leung made his debut as the villainous henchman Sang in Brett Ratner’s Rush Hour. Ratner stated, “[Leung]’s a great actor. In my opinion, he’s equivalent to Philip Seymour Hoffman as far as talent is concerned.” He would later work with Ratner in the films Red Dragon, The Family Man, and X-Men: The Last Stand. Edward Norton cast Leung in his directorial debut Keeping the Faith in 2000. According to The Washington Post, Norton said Leung’s “showstopping performance…turned a throwaway scene into one of the film’s best.” Impressed with his acting skills, Norton said that Leung would be appropriate for a role in Hamlet or Osborne’s Look Back in Anger: “You sense hidden levels within him and he conveys an intensity of mind. I don’t think anybody’s tapped his full range yet.” Additionally, Leung has appeared in several independent and television films, as well as features, including four films with Brett Ratner and two with Spike Lee. In 1998, he played James the Less and God in Terrence McNally’s passion play, Corpus Christi, and in 2002 made his Broadway debut in the musical Thoroughly Modern Millie, also appearing on the cast recording.</p><p>In 2007, he starred in the independent film Shanghai Kiss with Hayden Panettiere, and earned a Special Mention at the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival.
