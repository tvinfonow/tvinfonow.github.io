Multi-year NHRA drag racing champion who debuted in the Top Fuel class in 1996, setting a speed record in 1999 in the quarter-mile at 337.58 mph.</p><p>He worked with NHRA funny car champion <a href=#>John Force</a> to develop a protective sensor that detects engine backfire.</p><p>The very first race for which Schumacher qualified was in 1996, at the MAC Tools U.S. Nationals, qualifying 16th. However, during that event, tragedy struck during qualifying when then points leader Blaine Johnson was killed in an accident. Schumacher would have raced Blaine the following day. He honored the fallen driver as he idled down the track. He made it all the way to the finals, before losing to his former DSR teammate, Cory McClenethan. In 2007, Schumacher joined Michael Anthony (ex-Van Halen bass guitarist) on stage at the Chicago Theater.</p><p>Doug Kalitta dominated throughout 2006, but Schumacher came into the last race on his heels. Kalitta qualified number 1 and Schumacher number 2. Schumacher needed to go two rounds further than Kalitta as well as set a national record in order to win the title. Kalitta would met Schumacher’s teammate, Melanie Troxel, in round 3 and lost on a hole shot. That opened the door for Schumacher, who had to beat almost all odds to win the championship. He made it to the final where he had to run a new Top Fuel national record. He won the race and championship</p><p align=justify>His father Don Schumacher was an NHRA funny car driver.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tony Schumacher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tony</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Schumacher</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Race Car Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Don Schumacher, Susann F.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Tony Schumacher</b>'s net worth <strong>$10 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He learned how to play guitar as a boy growing up in California.</p><p align=justify>He earned sponsorship from the United States Army.</p><p align=justify>Tony Schumacher (born December 25, 1969), is an American drag racer who is an eight-time NHRA Champion. He is the son of NHRA legend Don Schumacher. He attended St. John’s Military Academy in Delafield Wisconsin. Schumacher is currently the driver of a Top Fuel Dragster seeking sponsorship.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Race Car Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 2008, along with the 15 time Funny Car Champion John Force, and the former champion Funny Car, and retired 4 times Funny Car champion and twice Top Fuel world champion Kenny Bernstein, in concert with NHRA’s track safety programs, Schumacher helped to develop a sensor that detects any engine backfire in a nitromethane engine, and takes corrective steps to protect the driver, shutting down the fuel pump, and deploying the parachutes. This experiment was a direct result of the death of the Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta, and according to several drivers should dramatically cut down on the number of accidents caused by engine explosions.</p><p>At the end of the 2008 season, he parted ways with longtime crew chief Alan Johnson, who went on to form his own team, Al-Anabi Racing. Al-Anabi Racing consisted of Top Fuel driver Del Worsham and the driver Schumacher considers his biggest rival, Larry Dixon. Many fans and media members felt Schumacher would not have the success he had in previous years as Johnson was the Army Top Fuel team’s tuner during his run of five consecutive titles. Schumacher met Dixon and Johnson in the semi-final round early in 2009 at The Strip in Las Vegas, beating his former crew chief’s new driver. Schumacher went on to win the event and won the following race in Houston.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tony Schumacher height</b> Not available right now.

He had 12 first round losses that year. In the last race, Rod Fuller was in first place, Larry Dixon was second, Brandon Berenstien was third, and Schumacher was in fourth place. Fuller lost in round 1, but his title hopes were still alive. Dixon lost in the second round, and his championship hopes were done. Schumacher and Brandon both advanced to the semi-finals and had to face each other. If Brandon won the round, he would be the champion. If Schumacher won the round, he would have to win the race to be the champion. Schumacher won the round, the race over Bob Vandergriff, and the championship by 19 points over Fuller.</p><p align=justify>Schumacher won the 2009 Top Fuel championship in dramatic fashion.
