Born in Los Angeles, Anderson developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. An alumnus of the Sundance Institute, Anderson made his feature film debut with Hard Eight in 1996. He found critical and commercial success with Boogie Nights (1997), set during the Golden Age of Porn, and received further accolades with Magnolia (1999), an ensemble piece set in the San Fernando Valley, and Punch-Drunk Love (2002), a romantic comedy-drama film.</p><p>Anderson was involved in filmmaking from a young age, and never really had an alternative plan to directing films. He made his first film when he was eight, and started making films on a Betamax video camera that his father bought in 1982. He later started using 8 mm film, but realized that video was easier. He began writing in adolescence, and began experimenting with a Bolex sixteen millimeter camera. After years of experimenting with “standard fare”, he wrote and filmed his first real production as a senior in high school at Montclair Prep using money he earned cleaning cages at a pet store. The film was a 30-minute mockumentary shot on video called The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), about a pornography star; the story was inspired by John Holmes, who also served as a major inspiration for Boogie Nights.</p><p align=justify>He began dating actress&nbsp;He began dating actress <a href=#>Maya Rudolph</a> in 2001.

After completing the film, Rysher re-edited it. Anderson, who still had the workprint of his original cut, submitted the film to the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown at the Un Certain Regard section. Anderson managed to get the version released, but only after he retitled the film, and raised the $200,000 necessary to finish it; Anderson, Philip Baker Hall, Gwyneth Paltrow and John C. Reilly contributed the funding. The version that was released was Anderson’s and the acclaim from the film launched his career. The film follows a senior gambler (Hall), who takes a homeless man (Reilly) under his wing, while he becomes romantically involved with a troubled waitress (Paltrow). It also featured Philip Seymour Hoffman as an arrogant gambler, beginning a five-film collaboration between the pair. In his review of the film, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert wrote, “Movies like Hard Eight remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us.”</p><h2>Paul Thomas Anderson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the <strong>richest Director</strong> from United States.

During their relationship, the two used ecstasy and cocaine, with Apple describing him as having a temper leaving her “fearful and numb”, throwing a chair across the room and shoving her out of his car falling to the ground.</p><p>Anderson began working on the script for his next feature film during his troubles with Hard Eight, completing the script in 1995. The result was his breakout film Boogie Nights, which is based on his short film The Dirk Diggler Story and is set in the Golden Age of Porn. The film follows a nightclub dishwasher (Mark Wahlberg) who becomes a popular pornographic actor under his stage name. The script was noticed by New Line Cinema’s president, Michael De Luca, who felt “totally gaga” reading it. It was released on October 10, 1997 and was a critical and commercial success. The film revived the career of Burt Reynolds, and provided breakout roles for Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. After the film’s production, Reynolds refused to star in Anderson’s third film Magnolia. At the 70th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Reynolds), Best Supporting Actress (Moore) and Best Original Screenplay.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Paul Thomas Anderson height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Paul <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For $10,000, made up of gambling winnings, his girlfriend’s credit card, and money his father set aside for him for college, Anderson made Cigarettes & Coffee (1993), a short film connecting multiple story lines with a twenty-dollar bill. The film was screened at the 1993 Sundance Festival Shorts Program. He decided to expand the film into a feature-length film and was subsequently invited to the 1994 Sundance Feature Film Program. Michael Caton-Jones served as Anderson’s mentor. He saw Anderson as someone with “talent and a fully formed creative voice but not much hands-on experience” and gave him some hard and practical lessons.</p><p align=justify>After the success of Boogie Nights, New Line told Anderson that he could do whatever he wanted for his next film and granted him creative control. Though Anderson initially wanted to make a film that was “intimate and small-scale”, the script “kept blossoming”. The resulting film was the ensemble piece Magnolia (1999), which tells the story of the peculiar interaction of several individuals in the San Fernando Valley. Anderson used the music of Aimee Mann as a basis and inspiration for the film, commissioning her to write eight new songs. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including for Best Supporting Actor (Tom Cruise), Best Original Song for “Save Me” by Aimee Mann and Best Original Screenplay. Anderson stated after the film’s release that “what I really feel is that Magnolia is, for better or worse, the best movie I’ll ever make.”</p><h2>Who is Paul Thomas Anderson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Paul Thomas Anderson</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
