After an 11-4 start out of the gate, the Bears stumbled, losing five of their next six games. However, beginning midway through February 2000, Hinson’s team won their final eight regular season contests and fell just short of forcing a tie for the Missouri Valley Conference regular season title. The Bears continued their hot streak, claiming victory in their first two games of the MVC tournament, a streak halted only by a loss in the tourney final.</p><h2>Barry Hinson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Barry Hinson is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Coach</strong> from United States.

Despite being picked to finish ninth in the Missouri Valley, Hinson lead the improved Salukis to early season success with an 11-2 non-conference record. The Salukis finished tied for fourth in the Missouri Valley regular season before looking overmatched and losing to Northern Iowa in the conference tournament. They ended 22-10 overall and 11-7 in MVC play, marking the first winning season for the Salukis since 2007-08 and the first twenty win season since 2006-07. However, a weak non-conference schedule and a below average year for its conference meant no NCAA or NIT bid for the team.</p><h2>Who is Barry Hinson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Barry Hinson</strong> married to <strong>Angie Hinson</strong>.

MSU accepted a bid to the NIT for the third straight year. They were handed a home loss by San Diego State by the score of 74-70. Despite having won a modest 22 games, some fans were calling for Missouri State to replace Hinson. However, when the season was complete, MSU President Michael T.
