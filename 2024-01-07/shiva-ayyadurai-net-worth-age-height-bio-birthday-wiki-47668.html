In the latter part of the 1970s, when he was working with the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey, this teenage young computer scientist developed an in-office method of mail delivery which he named “EMAIL.”&nbsp;The system was copied-righted in 1982, and a lot of debate remains about whether he deserves to be acknowledged as the inventor of email.</p><p>Ayyadurai as well as his spouse met during an event hosted by author and self-help expert&nbsp;Ayyadurai and his wife met while attending a conference hosted by self-help author <a href=#>Deepak Chopra</a>..</p><p>V. A. Shiva Ayyadurai (born Vellayappa Ayyadurai Shiva, December 2, 1963) is an Indian-American scientist, engineer, politician, entrepreneur, and promoter of conspiracy theories and unfounded medical claims. He is notable for his widely discredited claim to be the “inventor of email”, based on the electronic mail software called “EMAIL” he wrote as a New Jersey high school student in the late 1970s. Initial reports that repeated Ayyadurai’s assertion—from organizations such as The Washington Post and the Smithsonian Institution—were followed by public retractions. These corrections were triggered by objections from historians and ARPANET pioneers who pointed out that email was already actively used in the early 1970s.</p><p>David Crocker, a member of the ARPANET research community, writing in the Post, said, “The reports incorrectly credited [EMAIL’s] author, a 14-year-old in the late 1970s, as the ‘inventor’ of email, long after it had become an established service on the ARPANET.” Another computer historian, Marc Weber, a curator at the Computer History Museum, said that by 1978, “nearly all the features we’re familiar with today had appeared on one system or another over the previous dozen years”, including emoticons, mailing lists, flame wars, and spam mail.</p><p align=justify>The initial seven years that he lived living in Bombay, India, and the rest of his life living in America.

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Writing for Gizmodo, Sam Biddle argued that email was developed a decade before EMAIL, beginning with Ray Tomlinson’s sending the first text letter between two ARPANET-connected computers in 1971. Biddle quoted Tomlinson: “[We] had most of the headers needed to deliver the message (to:, cc:, etc.) as well as identifying the sender (from:) and when the message was sent (date:) and what the message was about.” Biddle allowed for the possibility that Ayyadurai may have coined the term “EMAIL” and used the header terms without being aware of earlier work, but maintained that the historical record isn’t definitive on either point. Biddle wrote that “laying claim to the name of a product that’s the generic term for a universal technology gives you acres of weasel room. But creating a type of airplane named AIRPLANE doesn’t make you Wilbur Wright.”</p><h2>Shiva Ayyadurai Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Shiva Ayyadurai is one of the <strong>richest Inventor</strong> from India.

While a student at Livingston High School in New Jersey, Ayyadurai volunteered at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) where his mother worked. There he created an email system to emulate the paper-based interoffice mail system then in use at the medical school. In 1982, he registered the copyright for his software, called “EMAIL”, as well as for the program’s user documentation.</p><p>Ayyadurai makes the widely disputed claim to be the “inventor of email”.

In a followup to its acquisition announcement, the Smithsonian stated that it was not claiming that Ayyadurai had invented email, but rather that the materials were historically notable for other reasons related to trends in computer education and the role of computers in medicine. The Smithsonian statement distinguished Ayyadurai’s achievement by noting that historians in the field, “have largely focused on the use of large networked computers, especially those linked to the ARPANET in the early 1970s”. The statement pointed out that Ayyadurai’s approach instead “focused on communications between linked computer terminals in an ordinary office situation”. The Washington Post also followed up with a correction of errors in its earlier report on the Smithsonian acquisition, stating that it incorrectly referred to Ayyadurai as the inventor of electronic messaging; the ‘bcc’, ‘cc’, ‘to’ and ‘from’ fields existed previously; Ayyadurai had not been honored as the “inventor of email”.</p><p align=justify>In 1994, Ayyadurai founded a company called Millennium Cybernetics, which produces email management software originally called Xiva and now called EchoMail. The software analyzes incoming email messages to organizations before either replying automatically or forwarding it to the most relevant department. By 2001, customers included Kmart, American Express, and Calvin Klein, as well as more than thirty U.S. senators to help handle constituent email. EchoMail competed with more established customer relationship management software that had an email component. On its website, EchoMail describes Ayyadurai as the “Inventor of Email”.</p><h2>Who is Shiva Ayyadurai Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Shiva Ayyadurai</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Somehow it took him thirty years to alert the world to [his] greatest achievement”. Haigh wrote that by 1980, “electronic mail had been in use at MIT for 15 years, Xerox had built a modern, mouse-driven graphical email system for office communication, Compuserve was selling email access to the public, and email had for many years been the most popular application on what was soon to become the Internet.”</p><h2>Top Facts about Shiva Ayyadurai</h2><li>Shiva Ayyadurai claims to have invented email at age 14.</li><li>He holds four degrees from MIT.</li><li>Ayyadurai ran for Senate in Massachusetts in 2018.</li><li>He has been accused of promoting COVID-19 misinformation.</li><li>Ayyadurai is a vocal critic of vaccines and mask mandates.</li><li>In 2020, he sued Twitter for banning his account.</li><li>Ayyadurai founded the company CytoSolve, which uses AI for drug discovery.</li><li>He has also claimed to have invented “Cybersecurity Immune System.”</li><li>Ayyadurai’s net worth is estimated at $100 million USD.</li><li>His political views align with libertarianism and conservatism.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Shiva Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Inventor</strong>.
