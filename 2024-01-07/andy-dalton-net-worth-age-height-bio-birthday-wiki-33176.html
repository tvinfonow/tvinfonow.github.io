Nicknamed “The Red Rifle,” he led TCU to a Rose Bowl win in 2011. He then became the starting quarterback for the NFL’s Cincinnati Bengals after being selected in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.</p><p>He replaced <a href=#>Carson Palmer</a> as quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Dalton had a historically terrible performance against the Cleveland Browns in Game 9, where he completed 10 of 33 passes for 86 total yards with three interceptions to earn a 2.0 passer rating; the lowest by an NFL quarterback with 25 pass attempts since 2004 and the 11th lowest in history. He responded with 220 yards and three touchdowns for a season-best rating of 143.9 in a 27–10 win over the New Orleans Saints, and his first career win in four attempts against the Texans in Game 11. In Game 12 (11/30), Dalton rebounded from three first half interceptions to run for a touchdown and throw for another in a 14–13 Bengals’ win over the Buccaneers on the road. It marked the fourth consecutive year that Dalton had won three games against the NFC, extending his record to 12–3–1 against the opposite conference. The Bengals lost Game 13 against Pittsburgh despite Dalton’s solid 128.8 rating and 20-yard touchdown run (the longest ever by a Bengals quarterback), then shutout Cleveland despite his 53.6 rating. In Game 15, Dalton threw two touchdowns and an interception in a 37–28 win over the Broncos to help the Bengals clinch a playoff berth for a franchise-record fourth straight year. In the season’s final game, Dalton threw two first-half interceptions at Pittsburgh, but led an 89-yard fourth quarter drive capped by a five-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Gresham, to cut the deficit to 20–17, but despite a streak of 11 of 12 passes for 101 yards, A.J. Green fumbled inside Steelers’ territory to seal the 27–17 loss and a #5 wild card seed in the playoffs.</p><p>Dalton attended Katy High School in Katy, Texas, where he played on the Tigers football team. He split time as a junior in 2004 and then started only one full season at quarterback for Katy High School as a senior in 2005. That year, he led the Tigers to the state finals, where they lost to Southlake Carroll, 34–20. As a senior, he threw for 2,877 yards with 42 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. That year, he was named the Greater Houston Area offensive player of the year by the Houston Chronicle.</p><p align=justify>He married Jordan Dalton in July of 2011.
