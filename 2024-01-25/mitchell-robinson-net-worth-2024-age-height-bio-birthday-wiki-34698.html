He would be the first recruited draft pick to wind up not playing for any college, professional, or high school/postgraduate team throughout an entire year before entering an NBA draft, although he would still be credited as coming out of Western Kentucky by the NBA. Furthermore, because of his brief time going to summer classes in Western Kentucky, he was ultimately barred from participating in the NBA G League later in the season due to G League rules. The ruling also affected a few similar prospects who were stuck in difficult situations at the time as well, like Billy Preston and De’Anthony Melton. The announcement also influenced at least one person to train by themselves for a year before entering an NBA draft, as another five-star recruit named Darius Bazley originally planned on not going to college at Syracuse University in order to try out for the NBA G League before deciding against that as well, claiming that it was the only league where winning does not matter after all.</p><h2>Top Facts about Mitchell Robinson</h2><li>Mitchell Robinson is a center for the New York Knicks.</li><li>He was born on April 1, 1998 in Pensacola, Florida.</li><li>Robinson played one year of college basketball at Western Kentucky University.</li><li>He was selected by the Knicks in the second round of the 2018 NBA draft.</li><li>In his rookie season, he set a franchise record for most consecutive games with multiple blocks (nine).</li><li>Robinson led all rookies in field goal percentage during the 2018-19 season.</li><li>He averaged 9.7 points and 7 rebounds per game during the 2019-20 season.</li><li>Robinson has been named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team (2019).</li><li>He has a career high of 23 points and 18 rebounds in a single game.</li><li>Robinson is known for his shot-blocking ability and athleticism on both ends of the court.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Mitchell Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Basketball Player</strong>.
