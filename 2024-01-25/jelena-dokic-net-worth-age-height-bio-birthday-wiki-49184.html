Who is Jelena Dokic dating now & how much money does Jelena Dokic have?</p><h2>Jelena Dokic Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jelena Dokic</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Tennis Player</strong> who was born on <strong>April 12, 1983</strong> in Osijek Country Socialist Federal Republic Of Yugoslavia Located In The Administrative Territorial Entity Socialist Republic Of Croatia, <strong>Yugoslavia</strong>. Jelena Dokic (Serbian: Jelena Dokić / Јелена Докић ; pronounced&nbsp;[jɛ̌lɛna dokit͡ɕ] ; born 12 April 1983, in Osijek, Croatia) is an Australian tennis coach, commentator, writer, and former professional tennis player. Her highest ranking as a tennis player was world No. 4 in August 2002. She won WTA Tour events on all surfaces during her career.</p><p>Dokic rapidly ascended through the world rankings after her Wimbledon breakthrough, but her time in the world elite was beset by off-court struggles. Her relationship with her outspoken father and coach Damir Dokić, on whose advice she switched allegiance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in November 2000, was the subject of much media speculation over many years. She switched back to Australia in 2005, and accused her father of physical and mental abuse in her 2017 autobiography Unbreakable.</p><p>In 2003, Dokic hired Borna Bikić from Croatia to replace her father as her trainer. She played 30 events, reaching one final, one semifinal, and seven quarterfinals. At Wimbledon she narrowly lost in the third round 4–6, 4–6 to a 16-year-old Maria Sharapova. At Zürich, she beat the then world No. 1 player, Clijsters, but lost to Henin in the final. She and Petrova also reached a final in doubles in Rome. She played in the 2004 Fed Cup for the Serbia and Montenegro team and achieved two wins.</p><p>In mid-2004, Dokic returned to her family in Serbia to attempt a reconciliation. In November 2005, after a turbulent period of 4–5 months during which she canceled all her tennis commitments and not even her family knew her whereabouts, she returned to Australia proclaiming, “I am an Australian, I feel like an Australian and I want to play for Australia again.” She later identified her switch to Yugoslavia as the biggest regret of her career, and said her father was subjecting her to extreme physical and mental abuse at the time he made the decision for her.</p><p align=justify>In the 1999 Wimbledon Championships the 16-year-old Dokic achieved one of the biggest upsets in tennis history, beating Martina Hingis 6–2, 6–0. This remains the only time the women’s world No. 1 has ever lost to a qualifier at Wimbledon. Dokic went on to reach the quarterfinals of that competition, only her second Grand Slam.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jelena Dokic</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jelena</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jelena</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tennis Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Osijek Country Socialist Federal Republic Of Yugoslavia Located In The Administrative Territorial Entity Socialist Republic Of Croatia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yugoslavia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Damir Dokić, Ljiljana Dokić</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Savo Dokić</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jelena Dokic ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
