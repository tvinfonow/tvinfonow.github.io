Green explained to Courtney his vision for Myers’ mannerisms, an amalgamation of the performance of Nick Castle, 1978 Myers actor, and the addition of a feline style of movement. Courtney tailored his portrayal to those specifications by observing the movement of his cat: “I think cats are the most perfect hunting machines on the planet. And the beauty of it is we don’t judge a cat for what a cat does. So I sort of carried that movement and the non-judgmental approach to the way I moved as The Shape, which I learned from my cat Parcival.” Courtney used Carpenter and Castle’s work on the original film to inform how the forty years that transpired between the events of the films would affect the character. The December 2017 announcement of Castle’s participation in the film was widely reported as his retaking the role of Myers, with Courtney only doing additional work as the character. However, in a 2018 interview, Courtney stated that Castle’s screentime was minimal and that the great majority of the work under the mask was done by Courtney, which led to the question of whether Castle’s return had been misrepresented by the production. Honoring his portrayal of Michael Myers, October 19, the film’s United States opening day, was officially proclaimed James Jude Courtney Day in Warren County, Kentucky, by Warren County Judge-Executive Mike Buchanon. In January 2019, Courtney was nominated for Best Actor at the 2019 Fangoria Chainsaw Awards alongside Castle for his work in Halloween.</p><h2>Who is James Jude Courtney Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>James Jude Courtney</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
