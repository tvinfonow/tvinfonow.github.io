Who is Mukhtar Ansari dating now & how much money does Mukhtar Ansari have?</p><h2>Mukhtar Ansari Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Mukhtar Ansari</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Politician</strong> who was born on <strong>June 30, 1963</strong> in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, <strong>India</strong>.</p><p>In the early 1970s, the government commissioned several development projects in the backward Poorvanchal area. This resulted in the rise of organised gangs that competed with each other to grab the contracts for these projects. Mukhtar Ansari was originally a member of the Makhanu Singh gang. In the 1980s, this gang clashed with another gang led by Sahib Singh, over a plot of land in Saidpur, resulting in a series of violent incidents. Brijesh Singh, a member of Sahib Singh’s gang, later formed his own gang and took over Ghazipur’s contract work mafia in the 1990s. Ansari’s gang competed with him for the control of the ₹ 100 crore contract business, which spanned areas such as coal mining, railway construction, scrap disposal, public works and liquor business. The gangs were also involved in running protection (“goonda tax”) and extortion rackets, besides other criminal activities such as kidnapping.</p><p>By the early 1990s, Mukhtar Ansari was well known for his criminal activities, especially in the districts of Mau, Ghazipur, Varanasi and Jaunpur. He entered politics around 1995, became an MLA in 1996, and started challenging Brijesh Singh’s dominance. The two became the main gang rivals in the Poorvanchal region. In 2002, Singh ambushed Ansari’s convoy. Three of Ansari’s men were killed in the resulting shootout. Brijesh Singh was critically injured and presumed dead. Ansari became the undisputed gang leader in Poorvanchal. However, Brijesh Singh was later found to be alive, and the feud resumed. To counter Ansari’s political influence, Singh supported the election campaign of the BJP leader Krishnanand Rai. Rai defeated Mukhtar Ansari’s brother and five-time MLA Afzal Ansari from the Mohammadabad in the 2002 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Mukhtar Ansari later claimed that Rai used his political office to award all the contracts to Brijesh singh’s gang, and the two planned to eliminate him.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mukhtar Ansari</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Armand</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Biniakounou</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ghazipur</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Uttar Pradesh</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>India</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Afzal Ansari, Sibakatullah Ansari</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Afsa Ansari</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Abbas Ansari, Umar Ansari</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mukhtar Ansari ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
