The band released a single record, No Spiritual Surrender, on Revelation Records in 1990 before breaking up.

The band was on the main stage at Lollapalooza by 1993 and was one of the most politically charged bands ever to receive extensive airplay from radio and MTV. Rage’s second and third albums peaked at number one in the United States, but did not result in the political action de la Rocha had hoped for. He became increasingly restless and undertook collaborations with artists such as KRS-One, Chuck D, and Public Enemy. He left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, citing “creative differences,” at which time he issued a statement saying: “it was necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed”, in reference to the disagreement over the release of Renegades. The other members of the band sought out separate management and secured the immediate release of Renegades. After searching for a replacement for de la Rocha, the other members of Rage joined Chris Cornell of Soundgarden to form Audioslave.</p><h2>Zack de la Rocha Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Zack de la Rocha is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States.

Morello recruited former Greta drummer Brad Wilk–who had previously auditioned for Lock Up before that band’s dissolution earlier that same year–and de la Rocha recruited his former Juvenile Expression bandmate, Tim Commerford, to play bass.
