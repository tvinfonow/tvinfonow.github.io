Erica became known as the “first official Green Day fan” as she listened to the first four-track recordings by Armstrong and Sean Hughes, encouraging the band, touring with them and acting as occasional photographer for the band. Erica inspired many of Green Day’s well known songs including “Christie Road”, which was written about the local railroad tracks where she and Armstrong would sneak out to meet. When Armstrong began living in punk houses and warehouses at the age of seventeen, including the warehouse above a West Oakland brothel which ultimately inspired the song “Welcome to Paradise” Erica would often stay with him despite the dangers, “I would stay with him sometimes in these warehouses full of crusty punks”. The couple split in late 1991. Erica is the sister of former Green Day touring member (2004–2005) Mike Pelino, and the sister-in-law of Janna White, wife of Pinhead Gunpowder vocalist/guitarist and Green Day touring guitarist Jason White.</p><h2>Who is Billie Joe Armstrong Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Billie Joe Armstrong</strong> married to <strong>Adrienne Armstrong </strong>.
