Entrepreneur, investor, stockbroker, motivational speaker, author, and philanthropist who was homeless in the early 1980s.</p><p>He was portrayed by <a href=#>Will Smith</a> in the 2006 film adaptation of his novel.</p><p>Christopher Paul Gardner (born February 9, 1954) is an American businessman and motivational speaker. During the early 1980s, Gardner struggled with homelessness while raising a toddler son. He became a stock broker and eventually founded his own brokerage firm Gardner Rich & Co in 1987. In 2006, Gardner sold his minority stake in the firm and published a memoir. That book was made into the motion picture The Pursuit of Happyness starring Will Smith.</p><p>Inspired by his Uncle Henry’s worldwide adventures in the U.S. Navy, Gardner decided to enlist when he finished secondary schooling. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina for four years, where he was assigned as a hospital corpsman. He became acquainted with a decorated San Francisco cardiac surgeon, Dr. Robert Ellis, who offered Gardner a position assisting him with innovative clinical research at the University of California Medical Center and Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco. Gardner accepted the position, and moved to San Francisco upon his discharge from the Navy in 1974. Over the course of two years, he learned how to manage a laboratory and to perform various surgical techniques. By 1976, he had been given full responsibility for a laboratory and had co-authored several articles with Dr. Ellis that were published in medical journals.</p><p align=justify>He fathered one son with ex-wife Sherry Dyson.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chris Gardner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gardner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Milwaukee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wisconsin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bettye Jean Triplett, Thomas Turner</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sherry Dyson</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Christopher Jarrett Medina Gardner, Jacintha Darlene Gardner</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Chris Gardner ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

With his knowledge, experience and contacts within the medical field, it appeared Gardner had his medical career plans laid out before him. However, with ten years of medical training ahead of him and with changes in health care just on the horizon, he realized that the medical profession would be vastly different by the time he could practice medicine. Gardner was advised to consider more lucrative career options; a few days before his 26th birthday, he informed his wife, Sherry, of his plans to abandon his dreams of becoming a physician.</p><p align=justify>In 1987, Gardner established the brokerage firm, Gardner Rich & Co, in Chicago, Illinois, an “institutional brokerage firm specializing in the execution of debt, equity, and derivative products transactions for some of the nation’s largest institutions, public pension plans, and unions.” His new company was started in his small Presidential Towers apartment, with start-up capital of $10,000 and a single piece of furniture: a wooden desk that doubled as the family dinner table. The “Rich” in the name was in honor of commodities trader Marc Rich, who had no connection to the company and whom Gardner had never met, but whom Gardner considered “one of the most successful futures traders in the world.”</p><h2>Who is Chris Gardner Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Chris Gardner</strong> married to <strong>Sherry Dyson </strong>.
