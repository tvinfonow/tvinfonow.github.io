He is best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Sin Cara (Spanish for “Faceless”), where he was the second and longest-tenured wrestler to use the persona.</p><p>In early 2004, he began working regularly for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), CMLL’s main Mexican rival and had to change his name in order to avoid any type of legal problems. With minor adjustments to his mask and tights, he became known as “Incognito” instead. While he was signed to AAA for over a year, Incognito made few wrestling appearances, spending most of his time training in AAA’s school to improve his wrestling skills. In 2005, he had left AAA and began working for various independent wrestling promotions on both sides of the US/Mexico border, exploiting the fact that he was a US citizen and spoke English well to get more bookings in the US than most luchadors typically can.</p><p align=justify>He worked at the funeral home of his grandfather as he grew as a child.&nbsp;He has an adult son.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sin Cara</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cara</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>El Paso</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jorge Arias</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Sin Cara ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Incognito was part of an eight-man team consisting only of masked wrestlers (Equinox, Las Chivas Rayadas, Lince Dorado, Los Ice Creams and Magno). The team lost to The Kings of Wrestling. Incognito returned to Chikara in 2008 for a series of appearances. He teamed with El Pantera and Lince Dorado to form the team Los Luchadores de Mexico (Spanish for “the Wrestlers from Mexico”) winning Chikara’s 28-team King of Trios 2008 tournament when they defeated BLKOUT (Eddie Kingston, Joker and Ruckus) in the finals. Incognito went on to win the 2008 Rey de Voladores (“King of the Fliers”) tournament when he defeated Helios in the finals on May 18, 2008.

On April 3 he teamed with Chris Hero and Eddie Edwards to defeat Jay Briscoe, Kevin Steen and Magno and on April 4 he teamed with Hero, Edwards and Davey Richards in a loss to El Generico, Steen, Briscoe and Magno.</p><p>On December 14, 2009 Arias worked a “try out” match for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) working without a mask, under his real name, losing a tag team match against The Dudebusters. Shortly after Arias signed a developmental deal with WWE following his try out match and started in WWE’s farm league Florida Championship Wrestling. He later changed his ring name to Hunico although his mask and outfit remained unchanged. In April Hunico began teaming with Tito Colon, wrestling Florida Tag Team Champions The Uso Brothers (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso) but were unsuccessful. Later on Tito Colon was given a new ring persona, an enmascarado (masked) character called “Dos Equis” (after the Dos Equis beer), which was later changed to “Epico”, and the team was named Los Aviadores (Spanish for “The Aviators”). On June 3, 2010 Los Aviadores defeated The Uso Brothers to win the Florida Tag Team Championship. On July 15 Los Aviadores lost the tag team titles to Kaval and Michael McGillicutty, but regained the titles the following day in a rematch. On August 12 Hunico and Epico lost the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship to Johnny Curtis and Derrick Bateman in a three-way match, which also involved the team of Donny Marlow and Brodus Clay. On July 26, 2011, Hunico wrestled in a dark match at the NXT tapings, losing to Justin Gabriel.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sin Cara height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Sin <strong>weight</strong> <strong>90 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>90 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Arias began wrestling in Burges High School, where he was an accomplished state champion multiple times. He then embarked onto a professional career, as he managed to continue working for his family’s funeral home and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico in the early 2000s under the ring name “Mistico”. This masked ring persona may or may not have preceded the debut of Místico (Luis Urive) in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) around the same time period, but CMLL won the legal rights to the name “Místico” some time in 2005, forcing Arias to change his name to “Mystico” or “Mistico de Juarez”. On February 2, 2004 he defeated Nicho El Millonario to win the WWA Middleweight Championship but was stripped of the title in March when he had to stop wrestling in the Tijuana, Baja California area where the World Wrestling Association was based.</p><p align=justify>In January 2012, Hunico started a feud with Ted DiBiase after Hunico was offended that he was not invited to one of DiBiase’s Posse parties. After both wrestlers scored two wins apiece, Hunico defeated DiBiase on the February 17 SmackDown to end the feud. After his feud with DiBiase, Hunico wrestled extensively on Superstars, going on an unbeaten streak in Superstars singles matches by defeating the likes of Ezekiel Jackson, Yoshi Tatsu, and Justin Gabriel. In April, Camacho began regularly teaming with Hunico. In June, Hunico lost to the returning Sin Cara, on the June 4 Raw and at No Way Out. In the pre-show of Money in the Bank, Hunico and Camacho lost to the WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth in a non-title match. At Raw 1000 in July 2012, Hunico, along with Camacho and four other wrestlers attempted to ambush Kane to make a statement, but The Undertaker returned to save Kane, disposing of Hunico with a chokeslam and a tombstone piledriver. Hunico then underwent surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the knee.</p><h2>Who is Sin Cara Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Sin Cara</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

Arias subsequently lost a Mask vs. Mask match against Urive and began wrestling unmasked under the ring name Hunico. In 2013, after the release of Urive, Arias reprised his role as Sin Cara. In contrast to Urive, Arias’ portrayal of Sin Cara was bilingual due to Arias having grown up in the United States, and thus knowing how to speak both Spanish or English, and doing so depending on the intended audience, whereas Urive legitimately did not know English. In 2014, Arias won the NXT Tag Team Championship alongside Kalisto as a part of The Lucha Dragons. He departed the company in 2019.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Sin Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Wrestler</strong>.
