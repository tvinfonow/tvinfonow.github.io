Robert Lee Sweet, born March 21, 1960, is the drummer for the Christian metal band Stryper.&nbsp;The band was founded by him and his brother Michael as Roxx Regime or Roxx.&nbsp;Robert was known for his wild drumming style and impressive drum kit sounds.&nbsp;Sweet, unlike most drummers, faces the audience in the direction of the stage left or right when he plays. This allows the audience to see him without being obscured by the drumkit.&nbsp;Sweet began to use a sideways set-up in 1978 in order to improve his showmanship, and connect with the crowd.&nbsp;Sweet was also a major contributor to the group’s visual direction.</p><p>Sweet has become an endorser of Yamaha drums (previously Crushdrums), Stagg Cymbals and SKB Cases.</p><p align=justify>Sweet was a major player in Stryper’s reappearance by participating in 2000’s “Stryper Expo”, and a reunion concert in Costa Rica.&nbsp;Sweet was inspired by the success of the reception to push for a reunion of Stryper. This came in the form of an request from Hollywood Records for a new Best of compilation.&nbsp;They decided to record two new songs, and then go on tour to support the new album.&nbsp;Sweet toured 2003 with a reformed Stryper.&nbsp;2004 saw Stryper return to the studio to start work on Reborn, the August 2005 album. This was the first time Stryper had recorded original material in more than 15 years since 1990’s Against the Law.&nbsp;Murder by Pride, the Stryper album, was released in July 2009. This album was Sweet’s first album that Sweet didn’t record drums for. Studio musician Kenny Aronoff filled this role.&nbsp;However, he did participate in Stryper’s 25th Anniversary Tour to support the album.&nbsp;Sweet has been on every Stryper album.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert Sweet</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sweet</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drummer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lynwood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Sweet</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Starri Sweet</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Robert Sweet ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
