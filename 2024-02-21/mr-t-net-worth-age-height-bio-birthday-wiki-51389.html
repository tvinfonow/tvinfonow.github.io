Laurence Tureaud was born Laurence Tureaud. He is best known for being a “tough-guy” star on The A-Team as Clubber Lang, boxer in Rocky III and his work as a professional wrestling champion.</p><p>Once he was employed as a bodyguard by&nbsp;He was once employed as a bodyguard for <a href=#>Diana Ross</a>..</p><p>Mr. T was born Lawrence Tureaud in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest son in a family with twelve children. Tureaud, with his four sisters and seven brothers, grew up in a three-room apartment in the Robert Taylor Homes. His father, Nathaniel Tureaud, was a minister. After his father left when he was five, he shortened his name to Lawrence Tero. In 1970, he legally changed his last name to T. His new name, Mr. T., was based upon his childhood impressions regarding the lack of respect from white people for his family:</p><p>In 1980, Mr. T was spotted by Sylvester Stallone while taking part in NBC’s “America’s Toughest Bouncer” competition, a segment of NBC’s Games People Play. Although his role in Rocky III was originally intended as just a few lines, Mr. T was eventually cast as Clubber Lang, the primary antagonist. His catchphrase “I pity the fool!” comes from the film; when asked if he hates Rocky, Lang replies, “No, I don’t hate Balboa, but I pity the fool.” Subsequently, after losing out on the role of the title character’s mentor in The Beastmaster, Mr. T appeared in another boxing film, Penitentiary 2, and on an episode of the Canadian sketch comedy series Bizarre, where he fights and eats Super Dave Osborne, before accepting a television series role on The A-Team. He also appeared in an episode of Silver Spoons, reprising his old role as bodyguard to the character Ricky Stratton (played by Ricky Schroder). In the episode, he explains his name as “First name: Mister; middle name: period; last name T.” In one scene, when Ricky’s class erupts into a paper-ball-throwing melee, Mr. T throws his body in front of the objects, fully protecting his client.</p><p align=justify>Nathaniel was his father’s name and he was the youngest of his seven siblings and four sisters.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mr. T</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>T</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawrence Tureaud</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lesa Tureaud, Laurence Tureaud Jr., Erika Tureaud</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mr. T ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The movie featured an ensemble cast, many of whom were publicized figures from other areas of show business – comics Paul Rodriguez, Marsha Warfield, singer Irene Cara, bodybuilders David and Peter Paul (the “Barbarian Brothers”) – but who had only modest acting experience. Despite the wide range of performers, and more seasoned actors such as Adam Baldwin as the protagonist Albert, as well as Gary Busey and Max Gail, Mr. T was top billed and the central figure in the film’s publicity, with him literally towering over the other characters on the film’s poster. While the film, featuring the ensemble as a ragtag taxi company trying to hustle their way to solvency and respectability, performed modestly at the box office, its $16 million take exceeded its $12 million budget, it received mixed reviews critically. Janet Maslin, writing for The New York Times, described it as “a musical mob scene, a raucous, crowded movie that’s fun as long as it stays wildly busy, and a lot less interesting when it wastes time on plot or conversation.” Roger Ebert praised the movie’s “mindless, likable confusion” and criticized its “fresh off the assembly line” plot. It was the second feature in a prolific career for director Joel Schumacher.</p><h2>Mr. T Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mr. T is one of the <strong>richest TV Actor</strong> from United States.

A. Baracus in the 1980s television series The A-Team and as boxer Clubber Lang in the 1982 film Rocky III.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In The A-Team, he played Sergeant Bosco “B. A.” Baracus, an ex-Army commando on the run with three other members from the United States government “for a crime they didn’t commit.” As well as the team’s tough guy, B. A. was a genius mechanic but afraid of flying. When asked at a press conference whether he was as stupid as B. A. Baracus, Mr. T observed quietly, “It takes a smart guy to play dumb.” His role in The A-Team led to him making an appearance in the long-running sit-com Diff’rent Strokes in the sixth season opener “Mr. T and Mr. t” (1983), in which an episode of The A-Team is supposedly filmed in the family’s penthouse apartment. A Ruby-Spears-produced cartoon called Mister T premiered in 1983 on NBC. The Mister T cartoon starred Mr. T as himself, the owner of a gym where a group of gymnasts trained. He helped them with their training but they also helped him solve mysteries and fight crime in Scooby-Doo-style scenarios; thirty episodes were produced.</p><p>In 1984, Mr. T released an album titled Mr. T’s Commandments (Columbia/CBS Records), in much the same tone as his 1984 educational video, which instructed children to stay in school and to stay away from drugs. He followed it up the same year with a second album, titled Mr. T’s Be Somebody… or Be Somebody’s Fool! (MCA Records), featuring music from the eponymous film. In 2002, Mr. T appeared as a bartender in the video for “Pass the Courvoisier, Part II” by Busta Rhymes featuring Sean Combs and Pharrell Williams.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Mr. T height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Mr. <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Eddie Murphy discusses Mr. T in his 1983 stand-up special Eddie Murphy Delirious.</p><p align=justify>Mr. T entered the world of professional wrestling in 1985. He was Hulk Hogan’s tag-team partner at the World Wrestling Federation’s (WWF) WrestleMania I which he won. Hulk Hogan wrote in his autobiography that Mr. T saved the main event of WrestleMania I between them and “Rowdy” Roddy Piper and “Mr. Wonderful” Paul Orndorff because when he arrived, security would not let his entourage into the building. Mr. T was ready to skip the show until Hogan personally talked him out of leaving. Piper has said that he and other fellow wrestlers disliked Mr. T because he was an actor and had never paid his dues as a professional wrestler. Remaining with the WWF, Mr. T became a special “WWF boxer” in light of his character in Rocky III. He took on “Cowboy” Bob Orton on the March 1, 1986 Saturday Night’s Main Event V, on NBC. This boxing stunt culminated in another boxing match against Roddy Piper at WrestleMania 2. As part of the build-up for the match, Piper attacked Mr. T’s friend, midget wrestler the Haiti Kid on his Piper’s Pit interview slot, shaving his head into a mohican style like that of Mr. T. Mr. T won the boxing match in Round 4 by Disqualification after Piper attacked the referee and bodyslammed Mr. T. He returned to the World Wrestling Federation as a special guest referee in 1987 as well as a special referee enforcer confronting such stars as The Honky Tonk Man.</p><h2>Who is Mr. T Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Mr. T</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

The video is roughly one hour long, but contains 30 minutes of singing, either by the group of children accompanying him, or by Mr. T himself. He sings “Treat Your Mother Right (Treat Her Right),” and also raps a song about growing up in the ghetto and praising God. The raps in this video were written by Ice-T.
