The youngest of his four older sisters moved towards punk music and Rzeznik became interested in bands such as Ramones and The Clash. Rzeznik attributes his gift for melody to listening to bands such as Kiss, Cheap Trick, The Cure and Rush in the early 1980s. Rzeznik also cites Paul Westerberg as an “obvious influence” on his music. Westerberg co-wrote the 1993 Goo Goo Dolls song “We Are the Normal” with Rzeznik, who reflected on the experience by stating “To some people, Keith Richards is their hero. I feel that way about Westerberg. Keith Richards got to do his thing with Chuck Berry, and I got to do it with Westerberg. That was amazing to me.”</p><p>Rzeznik’s father died on February 2, 1981, from a diabetic coma at the age of 53, when Rzeznik was 15 years old. On October 26, 1982, his mother died from a sudden heart attack in the family’s living room at the age of 51.

Now without an amplifier, Rzeznik borrowed a near-identical Marshall JCM800 from a mutual friend of the band, Charles Root. This amp was then used to record Hold Me Up and Superstar Car Wash. Since the late ’90s, Rzeznik has used Fender electric guitars. He has used many variations such as the Stratocaster, Telecaster, Jaguar and a “Halfcaster” (a Stratocaster cut in half). He also used Guild acoustic guitars on the “Dizzy Up the Girl” and “Gutterflower” tours. Rzeznik in a 2003 interview noted that “No matter what guitar I have it seems that anything with strings makes music to my ears.” Guild models used include several D-55s (unusually, most of his D-55s were built in Fender’s Corona, California Shop), a black F65CE, multiple Peregrine/S7CE Customs (a Guild Custom Shop Model), a black Songbird/S4CE, and a black F47M. Live performances of this time sometimes showed the auxiliary guitarist, Greg Suran, using some Guild acoustics such as the DV-52 and F-47M in natural finishes.</p><h2>John Rzeznik Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>John Rzeznik is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United States.
