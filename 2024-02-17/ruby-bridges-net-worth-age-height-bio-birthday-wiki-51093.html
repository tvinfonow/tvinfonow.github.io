After becoming the first African American child to attend an all white school on November 14, 1960, she was a pivotal figure in civil rights movements.</p><p>In 1964,&nbsp;She was immortalized in <a href=#>Norman Rockwell</a>‘s painting entitled The Problem We All live With, in 1964.&nbsp;painted a painting called The Problem We All Live With that immortalized her.</p><p>Bridges attended a segregated kindergarten in 1959. In early 1960, Bridges was one of six black children in New Orleans to pass the test that determined whether they could go to the all-white William Frantz Elementary School. Two of the six decided to stay at their old school, Bridges went to Frantz by herself, and three children were transferred to McDonogh No. 19 and became known as the McDonogh Three. Bridges and her mother were escorted to school by four federal marshals during the first day that Bridges attended William Frantz Elementary. In the following days of that year, federal marshals continue to escort Bridges, though her mom stayed behind to take care of her younger siblings.</p><p>Judge J. Skelly Wright’s court order for the first day of integrated schools in New Orleans on Monday, November 14, 1960, was commemorated by Norman Rockwell in the painting, The Problem We All Live With (published in Look magazine on January 14, 1964). As Bridges describes it, “Driving up I could see the crowd, but living in New Orleans, I actually thought it was Mardi Gras. There was a large crowd of people outside of the school. They were throwing things and shouting, and that sort of goes on in New Orleans at Mardi Gras.” Former United States Deputy Marshal Charles Burks later recalled, “She showed a lot of courage. She never cried. She didn’t whimper. She just marched along like a little soldier, and we’re all very very proud of her.”</p><p align=justify>Malcolm Hall was her husband and she had four children with him.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ruby Bridges</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ruby</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bridges</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Civil Rights Leader</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tylertown</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mississippi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lucille Bridges, Abon Bridges</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Malcolm Hall</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sean Hall, Christopher Hall, Craig Hall</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ruby Bridges ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
