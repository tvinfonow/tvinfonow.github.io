Who is Ed Hale dating now & how much money does Ed Hale have?</p><h2>Ed Hale Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Ed Hale</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Singer-Songwriter</strong> who was born on <strong>October 20, 1974</strong> in Paris, Paris, <strong>United States</strong>. Ed Hale (born October 20, 1974) is a writer, singer-songwriter-recording artist best known for his last solo album Ballad On Third Avenue and the three hit singles it produced, “I Walk Alone”, “New Orleans Dreams” and “Scene in San Francisco”, which all landed in the Billboard Top 40 Charts in the Adult Contemporary radio format.</p><p>The original name for Ed Hale’s second group was Ed Hale and The Troubadours of Transcendence. The name was very soon shortened to Ed Hale and Transcendence for the band’s debut album Rise and Shine released in 2002, and eventually shortened to simply Transcendence by the band’s second album release Sleep With You. The group originally had eleven members and was meant to be performing and recording what Hale was then calling “Planet Music.”</p><p>Hale has also founded and chairs a handful of non-profit projects, including his newest Fair Pay for Fair Play which focuses on legislation to gain fair compensation for music artists, the website www.TuneInTurnOnHelp.org which funnels attention and monies to various causes and charities, and www.PeaceWithIran.com, a website that attempts to act as a vehicle for journalists and alternative press coverage of Iran, and to expose more Westerners to the Iranian culture. Hale made two volunteer trips to the post-Hurricane Katrina Gulf Coast helping to rebuild homes in 2006, and in 2009 he took two more volunteer trips to a remote village outside of the city Cartagena in the country of Colombia to help build a Community and Health Center there. Hale also works locally with the New York City Mission Society volunteering with underprivileged children from the Bronx and Harlem and regularly volunteers with a local Food Bank, Covenant House, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and is a Red Cross Disaster Relief volunteer.</p><p>In 2006 Hale endeavored on a two-week work-trip to build homes and tour the slave castles in Ghana, Africa—which was filmed and posted to YouTube in a series of ten-minute episodes entitled “Going to Ghana”, an experience which had a major emotional impact on the singer, leading to his penning the song “Black Brother” from the forthcoming album Another Day in the Apocalypse. In 2008 Hale embarked on a controversial Peace Delegation trip to the country of Iran with The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) where he and 11 other Americans, including Rolling Stone contributing editor Robert Dreyfuss and the author Larry Beinhart met with leading government officials including former President Mohammad Khatami and leading religious clerics to discuss ways to improve US/Iranian relations and increase peace between the two countries. The film department at Siena College in New York is currently creating a one-hour documentary about Hale and his trip to Iran.</p><p align=justify>After the breakup of Broken Spectacles, Hale toured the East Coast as a solo artist and ended up moving to New York City. While there he recorded 12 demos for Sony Records which were never officially released by the record label. Ten of those demos were eventually remixed and digitally remastered and released on the Acoustic in New York album in 2000. It was also at this time that Hale began to discover World Music, especially the MPB and Tropicalismo music of Brazil and went to live in Brazil to study the language of Portuguese and learn how to play Bossa Nova, doing several live performances and appearing on Brazilian television. A video of this television appearance is available on YouTube.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed Hale</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer-Songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ed Hale ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
