He is best known for being the owner of the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks.&nbsp;He is also the President and CEO of Wirtz Corporation, a family-owned corporation.</p><p>He and He and Chicago Bulls owner <a href=#>Jerry Reinsdorf</a> are joint owners of the United Center, home of both the Bulls and the Blackhawks.&nbsp;, Chicago Bulls owner, are the joint owners of United Center.

In 1975, he graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Communications.</p><p>On October 22, 2007, Wirtz announced the team negotiated with Comcast SportsNet Chicago (now known as NBC Sports Chicago, of which he is part-owner) to televise home games. This was another break from his father’s management style, where games were previously unavailable on television unless they were nationally televised, which only happened in the playoffs. That season, they began to show 7 home games, with Wirtz citing pre-existing agreements Comcast had with other programming as a reason why the remaining 2007-08 home schedule cannot be shown. Wirtz hired former Chicago Cubs team president John McDonough, to become the new President of the team. Many believed that McDonough’s presence, along with the young talent on the roster, would improve the team’s marketing ability and reverse a long drought in popularity. This became evident when the team ranked 1st in the NHL for attendance in 2008-09 while making it to the Western Conference Finals. The team also hosted the Detroit Red Wings in the 2009 NHL Winter Classic at Wrigley Field that season.</p><p align=justify>He is the father of three children, Kendall, Hillary and Daniel.&nbsp;Arthur Wirtz, his grandfather, purchased the Blackhawks in 1954.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rocky Wirtz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rocky</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wirtz</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sports Executive</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rocky Wirtz ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

A big step showing this reconciliation was when the Blackhawks celebrated Hull and Mikita together at the United Center on Friday, March 7, 2008. While most of Wirtz’s changes were met with positive results, one decision was met with skepticism was his decision to lessen the use of the United Center’s organ in favor of more prerecorded current music to attract new, younger fans. This ended up being a blessing in disguise as the goal song “Chelsea Dagger” became a song other teams loved to hate.</p><p align=justify>In the 2015 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Blackhawks eliminated the Nashville Predators, Minnesota Wild, and Anaheim Ducks to reach the Finals.
