Known by fans and peers as “Beef,” he is widely known for his career playing in the European Championship. In April 2016, he earned his first career win on the tour at the Open de España.</p><p>He finished behind eventual winner <a href=#>Henrik Stenson</a> at 2016’s The Open Championship.</p><p>“One of the great, if all-too-infrequent, pleasures of being a film critic is having your mind blown by a film you didn’t expect much from. Such an incident occurred in December 1997, when I was assigned to review Jean Eustache’s 1973 film The Mother and the Whore, then beginning a revival engagement at Film Forum. Yes, I’d heard that it was a classic of French cinema, but I wasn’t exactly thrilled at catching an early-morning screening of a three-hour-and-thirty-five-minute foreign-language film that reportedly consisted of little more than people sitting around and talking. Frankly, I was a lot more excited about seeing Scream 2 that evening. Little did I know, as I eased into my seat, that I was in for one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of my life.”</p><p>Johnston identified Richard Kelly’s film Donnie Darko as one of the outstanding films at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001, describing it as “a heady blend of science fiction, spirituality, and teen angst.”</p><p align=justify>His father worked as a bus driver, and his mother a school dinner server.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrew Johnston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrew</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Johnston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Golfer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>London</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Noel Johnston</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Andrew Johnston ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

After earning an MS in Journalism at Columbia University, Andrew began his full-time professional career as a film critic at Time Out New York and subsequently served as film critic for US Weekly and Radar, before returning to Time Out New York as TV critic and editor of the Time In section. Andrew was a member of the New York Film Critics Circle and served as its Chairperson in 2003-2004. This was the year in which the award for best picture was given to The Return of the King, from The Lord of the Rings trilogy.</p><h2>Andrew Johnston Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Andrew Johnston is one of the <strong>richest Golfer</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Andrew Johnston</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He enjoyed a successful amateur career before officially turning pro in 2009. He earned his first professional tournament win that same year on the Jamega Tour.</p><p align=justify>He earned an 8th place finish at the PGA Tour’s The Open Championship major tournament. He also participated in that year’s US Open and PGA Championship, earning top-60 finishes in both.</p><p align=justify>Andrew Johnston (1968–2008) was a film and TV critic. He wrote primarily for Time Out New York and Us Weekly and was also editor of the “Time In” section of Time Out New York.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Golfer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In his list of best TV for 2005 in Time Out New York, Johnston cited Nip/Tuck, Six Feet Under, Lost, Deadwood, Veronica Mars, The Office, House, Weeds, The Shield and Battlestar Galactica, and gave honorable mention to Gilmore Girls, Rome, Medium, Rescue Me, My Name Is Earl, Project Runway, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Alias, Scrubs and Grey’s Anatomy. Writing about Deadwood, he commented, “If history is written by the victors, Deadwood is all about giving losers their due. In the first season, magnificent bastard Al Swearingen (Ian McShayne) came off as a villain; this year, his inevitably doomed campaign to save the lawless town from annexation by the United States and exploitation by robber barons served as a brilliant allegory for the evolution of American capitalism.”</p><p>The Wire was Johnston’s top pick for 2006. He wrote “The first three seasons of David Simon’s epic meditations on urban America established The Wire as one of the best series of the decade, and with season four–centered on the heart-breaking tale of four eighth-graders whose prospects are limited by public-school bureaucracy–it officially became one for the ages.” Friday Night Lights was also among Johnston’s top ten. Writing about this, he noted: “Who’d have thought a tribute to heartland values would turn out to be the most avant-garde show on TV? The music and random close-ups said more than the dialog in Peter Berg’s phenomenal football drama, which gave Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton the roles of a lifetime and (if there’s any justice)will secure stardom for newcomers Gaius Charles and Taylor Kitsch.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Andrew Johnston height</b> Not available right now.

On Mad Men: “Mere weeks after The Sopranos ended its run, David Chase protege Matthew Weiner offered up the next great TV drama. Drawing on the stories of John Cheever and the films of Billy Wilder for inspiration, Weiner’s chronicle of the advertising world in the early 1960s instantly established itself as one of the medium’s greatest studies of class in American society.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Andrew Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Golfer</strong>.
