Ronaldo won three FIFA World Player of the Year awards, two Ballon d’Or awards, a UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, a UEFA Club Best Forward and a European Golden Shoe.</p><p>At his physical peak in the 1990s, Ronaldo became severely affected by serious knee injuries he suffered from late 1999 onward and the subsequent weight gain during his inactivity, which limited his speed, fitness, and mobility. While acknowledging “he was never quite the same physiological masterpiece” after his knee injury in 2000, with “his pace and sheer brute force diminished in comparison to The Phenomenon” in the 1990s, FourFourTwo magazine ranked him the best player at the 2002 World Cup, adding “he was still a cut above the rest” in the tournament.</p><p align=justify>He was born to Nelio Jr. and had a son named&nbsp;He was raised with a brother named Nelio Jr., and he had a son, <a href=#>Ronald</a>, on April 6, 2000.

He had such an ease with the ball. Every day I trained with him, I saw something different, something new, something beautiful.” Michael Owen, who joined Madrid in 2004, acknowledged that he never got the chance to play with Ronaldo in his prime when “he had absolute blistering speed and strength, mesmerizing foot speed, he was just a blur, he’d be that fast”, before adding, “even in training, he showed more than enough to convince me that I would have loved to play with him at his peak.” Teammates for six months, Van Nistelrooy said, “Ronaldo was the best natural talent I ever played with. His innate ability went beyond anything that I’d ever seen or played alongside.”</p><h2>Ronaldo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ronaldo is one of the <strong>richest Soccer Player</strong> from Brazil.

Ronaldo has a brother, Nélio Jr. His parents separated when he was 11, and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football. He played on the streets of Bento Ribeiro, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. His mother states, “I always found him on the street playing ball with friends when he should have been in school. I know, I lost my battle.” He joined Social Ramos athletic indoor futsal team at the age of 12, and led the city youth league in scoring with a record 166 goals in his first season which included scoring 11 of his team’s 12 goals in a single game. Crediting futsal for developing his skills, Ronaldo has said, “futsal will always be my first love.” Spotted by former Brazilian player Jairzinho, who was coaching São Cristóvão, Ronaldo played for the São Cristóvão youth team where he showcased his talents on the field. Ronaldo’s agents in Brazil, Reinaldo Pitta and Alexandre Martins, signed him as a 13-year-old. Pitta stated, “We saw right away that he could be something different than most other players.” Recognized as a child prodigy, Jairzinho recommended the then 16-year-old to his former club Cruzeiro.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$160 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ronaldo scored 44 goals in 47 games with Cruzeiro, leading them to their first Copa do Brasil in 1993, and the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1994.

Dubbed Il (or O) Fenomeno (the phenomenon), he was a prolific goalscorer, and despite being more of an individualistic attacker, he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates, due to his vision, passing and crossing ability. He was an extremely powerful, fast, and technical player, with excellent movement, as well as being a composed finisher. Highly regarded for his technical ability, Ronaldo was able to use both feet, despite being naturally right footed, and is considered one of the most skilful dribblers in the game. Along with Brazilian compatriot Romário and Liberian star George Weah, Ronaldo was seen as a new breed of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. Often positioned near midfield, once in possession of the ball he would waste no time in making a beeline towards goal, with Rob Smyth writing, “he played like every attack had a 10-second deadline.. he would explode into life with no warning for defenders.” He frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed, and excelled in one on one situations, due to his ball control, acceleration, agility, balance and nimble footwork in his prime.</p><p align=justify>Ronaldo chose to join PSV after the 1994 World Cup. He was selected for the tournament despite being just 17, but did not play in any games. It was Romário who advised Ronaldo to move to PSV; Romário having played for PSV from 1988 to 1993. Ronaldo scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands. After scoring a hat-trick in PSV’s game against Bayer Leverkusen in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, Leverkusen striker and Germany World Cup winner Rudi Völler stated in a post match press conference, “Never in my life have I seen an 18-year-old play in this way.” His dribbles from midfield caught the attention of many in the sport, with future Barcelona teammate Luis Enrique stating, “I’d seen him on television at PSV and thought ‘wow’. Then he came to Barcelona. He’s the most spectacular player I’ve ever seen. He did things I’d never seen before. We’re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players, but not then. Ronaldo was a beast.”</p><h2>Who is Ronaldo Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ronaldo</strong> married to <strong>Maria Beatriz Antony , Daniella Cicarelli , Milene Domingues </strong>.
