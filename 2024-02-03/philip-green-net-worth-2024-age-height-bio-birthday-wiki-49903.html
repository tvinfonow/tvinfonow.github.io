As a Monaco resident, the company faces a significantly lower tax liability than if she were a UK resident.

Despite the deficit of £571m, Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. Referring to the conduct of Green, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said: “In this situation it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill.” Simon Walker, the Director General of the Institute of Directors, described Green’s “lamentable failure of behaviour” which was deeply damaging to the reputation of business. He then added that he had moral responsibilities to the pension fund and a proper investigation was needed but not one that took years. It took months for the negotiation to be settled down, it ended with Green agreeing to a voluntary settlement of £363m into the scheme.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Philip Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Entrepreneur</strong>.
