The youngest ever finalist in female singles competition in the US Open who accomplished the feat at just 13.&nbsp;Her age was the youngest participant overall to be selected for the main draw of Wimbledon and was the youngest female player to be selected for a main draw tournament at the course of any Grand Slam event.</p><p><a href=#>Serena Williams</a>‘ coach <a href=#>Patrick Mouratoglou</a> hand-selected her to be part of his Champ’Seed foundation when she was just 11 years old. She also trained with Patrick in France.’ coach&nbsp;Patrick Mouratoglou&nbsp;hand-selected her for his Champ’Seed foundation at only eleven years old.&nbsp;She also worked alongside Patrick during her time in France.</p><p>Gauff played in one US Open Series tournament at the Citi Open, where she qualified for the main draw but lost in the first round. She also entered the doubles event with Caty McNally and defeated Fanny Stollár and Maria Sanchez in the final for their first career WTA title in their first WTA event together. At the US Open, Gauff was awarded wild cards into the singles and doubles main draws. She continued her Grand Slam success in singles with two three-set wins over Anastasia Potapova and Tímea Babos, both on the Louis Armstrong show court. She was defeated in the third round by world No. 1 Naomi Osaka. In doubles, Gauff and McNally also won two matches, including an upset over ninth seeds Nicole Melichar and Kveta Peschke. They lost in the third round to eventual runners-up Ashleigh Barty and Victoria Azarenka. Gauff entered two more tournaments following the US Open. Although she lost in qualifying at the Linz Open, she entered the main draw as a lucky loser and won the title, notably upsetting top seed Kiki Bertens in the quarterfinals for her first top ten victory. She defeated Jeļena Ostapenko in the final to become the youngest WTA player to win a singles title since 2004. With this title as well as a semifinal in doubles with McNally, she made her top 100 debuts in both the WTA singles and doubles rankings.

Her father played college basketball at Georgia State University and later worked as a health care executive, while her mother was a track and field athlete at Florida State University and worked as an educator. Gauff initially grew up in Atlanta, and first became interested in tennis at the age of four after watching Serena Williams win the 2009 Australian Open on television with her family. Her parents encouraged her to try a wide variety of sports including basketball and track. She began playing tennis at the age of six and decided she wanted to pursue it as a career because it was an individual sport and because of her early success in winning the “Little Mo” eight-and-under nationals at the age of eight. Gauff recalled, “I wasn’t much of a team person. I loved tennis. I was so-so about it in the beginning because when I was younger I didn’t want to practice at all. I just wanted to play with my friends. When I turned eight, that was when I played ‘Little Mo’ and after that I decided to do that for the rest of my life.”</p><p align=justify>She has two younger brothers , and the parents of her were university athletes.&nbsp;Her father was an athlete from Georgia State University and her mother competed in track and field in Florida State University.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Coco Gauff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Coco</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gauff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tennis Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>2004</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Atlanta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georgia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cori Gauff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Candi Gauff, Corey Gauff</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cameron Gauff, Codey Gauff</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Coco Gauff ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Both of Gauff’s parents gave up their careers to focus on training their daughter, with her father later taking over as her primary coach and her mother overseeing her homeschooling. Her father had limited experience playing tennis growing up. At ten years old, Gauff also began to train at the Mouratoglou Academy in France that is run by Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams’s longtime coach. Mouratoglou commented, “I’ll always remember the first time I saw Coco. She came over to the Mouratoglou Academy in 2014 to try out and she impressed me with her determination, athleticism and fighting spirit… When she looks at you and tells you she will be number one, you can only believe it.” He helped sponsor Gauff through his Champ’Seed foundation, which he created to provide funding for talented junior tennis players who did not have the financial resources to afford high-level training. Gauff continued to have success — winning the USTA Clay Court National 12-and-under title at the age of 10 years and 3 months old — to become the youngest champion in the tournament’s history.</p><p>Gauff is a former world No. 1 junior.

She did not enter another tournament in singles until French Open, where she won her first career junior Grand Slam tournament title.
