Gang leader of the Chicago streets group Gangster Disciples later known as Growth and Development who went away to prison for life around the age of 45 after being charged with drug conspiracy and extortion.</p><p>He was referenced in the <a href=#>Rick Ross</a> song “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast)”.</p><p>On the evening of February 26, 1973, William “Pooky” Young, a 19–year old neighborhood youth drug dealer, was abducted and later shot to death in an alley near 68th Street and Union Avenue in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood. His killing was ordered by Hoover after his name was mentioned as one of three people accused of stealing drugs and money from the gang five days earlier. On March 16, 1973, Hoover and Young’s killer, Gangster Disciple member Andrew Howard, were both arrested. In November 1973, Howard and Hoover were both charged with murder and sentenced to 150 to 200 years in prison. Hoover was sent to Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, to serve out his term.</p><p>In 1974, after the leader of the Black Disciples, David Barksdale, died from kidney failure by an injury due to an earlier shooting, Hoover took the reins of the Black Gangster Disciples Nation while under his wing, which now had control of Chicago’s South Side. Under Hoover’s rule, the Black Gangster Disciples took over the South Side drug trade. While incarcerated, Hoover helped form the Folks Nation, which added other gangs such as: Black Disciples, Satan Disciples, Ambrose, Two-Two Boys, Gangster Two-Six, Simon City Royals, North Side Insane Popes, La Raza Nation, Spanish Cobras, Imperial Gangsters, Maniac Latin Disciples, Harrison Gents, Spanish Gangster Disciples and Latin Eagles. In 1989, The Black Gangster Disciples started to go against their own merger and ally, the Black Disciples, over a drug dealing dispute in the neighborhood of Englewood, Chicago that escalated into a shooting that killed several people. This infuriated members of BGDs and resulted in them changing their name into the “Gangster Disciples.” While Hoover was incarcerated, he ran the gang’s illicit drug trade both in prison and on the streets, starting from Chicago’s West Side and later extending throughout the United States. By early 1993, Hoover claimed to have renounced his violent criminal past and became an urban political celebrity in Chicago. The Gangster Disciples earned fans in the community with charity events and peaceful protests. Hoover proclaimed that initials GD had changed to mean “Growth & Development.” A lengthy federal investigation using wiretaps led to Hoover getting another life sentence in 1995. Hoover’s gang allegedly had 30,000 “soldiers” in 35 states and made $100 million a year, a total of approximately $3,300.00 per “soldier” annually.</p><p align=justify>He was born in Jackson, Mississippi to parents Larry and Samaya.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Larry Hoover</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Larry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hoover</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jackson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mississippi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Winndye Jenkins</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Larry Hoover, Jr., Samaya Hoover</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Larry Hoover ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
