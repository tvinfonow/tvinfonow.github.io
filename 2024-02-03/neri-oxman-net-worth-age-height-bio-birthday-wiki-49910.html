In 2006, she launched an interdisciplinary research project at MIT called materialecology, to experiment with generative design. This project and related collaborations informed her early art. She has promoted the idea of finding new ways to communicate about and collaborate on design. In 2016, she helped launch the open multidisciplinary Journal of Design Science.</p><h2>Neri Oxman Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Neri Oxman is one of the <strong>richest Architect</strong> from Israel.

It was woven by 6,500 free-ranging silkworms on a nylon-frame dome. Experiments with the silkworms identified how they would respond to different surfaces, and what would encourage them to spin onto an existing structure rather than spinning a cocoon. The frame of a large polyhedral dome was loosely woven by a robotic arm out of thin nylon threads, and suspended in an open room. The dome was designed with gaps where it would be warmest. Silkworms were released onto the frame in waves, where they added layers of silk before being removed. This involved engineering, sericulture, and modelling sun in the room. The resulting installation art was hung so that people could stand inside it.</p><h2>Who is Neri Oxman Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Neri Oxman</strong> married to <strong>Bill Ackman </strong>.

This was followed by Anthozoa, a dress developed in collaboration with fashion designer Iris van Herpen and materials engineer Craig Carter. These were some of the first examples of multi-color and multi-material 3D printing a human scale, using a bright palette with fine granular control of color and texture. In 2015, she designed the Wanderers collection with Christoph Bader and Dominik Kolb, inspired by ideas of interplanetary exploration. That earned Fast Company’s award for Design Innovation. The most influential of the Wanderers was the Living Mushtari chestpiece, a model digestive tract filled with liquid and a colony of photosynthetic bacteria and E. coli. Producing Mushtari required new modeling methods for printing long flexible tubes with varying thickness.</p><h2>Top Facts about Neri Oxman</h2><li>Neri Oxman is an Israeli-American architect, designer, and inventor.</li><li>She is a professor at the MIT Media Lab.</li><li>Oxman coined the term “Material Ecology” to describe her work.</li><li>Her designs are inspired by nature and biology.</li><li>Oxman has won numerous awards for her innovative work.</li><li>She has been named one of Fast Company’s Most Creative People in Business.</li><li>Oxman’s work has been exhibited at prestigious museums around the world.</li><li>She founded The Mediated Matter Group at MIT in 2010.</li><li>Oxman holds degrees in architecture, design, and computer science from top universities.</li><li>Her research focuses on merging technology with natural materials and processes.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Neri Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Architect</strong>.
