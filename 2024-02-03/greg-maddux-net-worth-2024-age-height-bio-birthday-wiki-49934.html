An eight-time All-Star pitcher, he was also known as Mad Dog and The Professor He was instrumental in leading the Atlanta Braves to a World Series Championship in 1995.&nbsp;In his entire career he was a winner of 355 games and pitched 3,371 batters in having an ERA of 3.16 record ERA.</p><p>He as well as&nbsp;He and <a href=#>Tom Glavine</a> became a dominant one-two pitching combination on the Braves for a number of years.&nbsp;became an extremely dominant two-pitch pitching team with the Braves for several years.</p><p>Gregory Alan Maddux (born April 14, 1966) is an American college baseball coach and former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He is the pitching coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Maddux is best known for his accomplishments while playing for the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. With the Braves, he won the 1995 World Series over the Cleveland Indians. The first to achieve a number of feats and records, he was the first pitcher in major league history to win the Cy Young Award four consecutive years (1992–1995), matched by only one other pitcher, Randy Johnson. During those four seasons, Maddux had a 75–29 record with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA), while allowing less than one baserunner per inning.</p><p>His brother, Mike, was drafted in 1982. When scouts went to observe the elder Maddux, their father, Dave, told them, “You will be back later for the little one.” Some baseball scouts were unimpressed by Maddux’s skinny build, but Chicago Cubs scout Doug Mapson saw past the physique. Mapson wrote a glowing review that read in part, “I really believe this boy would be the number one player in the country if only he looked a bit more physical.”</p><p align=justify>He was married to Kathy Maddux and he has one daughter named Amanda as well as a son named Chase.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Greg Maddux</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Greg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maddux</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1966</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>San Angelo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kathy Maddux</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Greg Maddux ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

His father exposed him to baseball at an early age. Upon his return to Las Vegas, Nevada, Maddux and his brother Mike trained under the supervision of Ralph Meder, a former scout from the majors. Meder preached the value of movement and location above velocity, and advised throwing softer when in a jam instead of harder. Maddux would later say, “I believed it. I don’t know why. I just did.” Though Meder died before Maddux graduated from Valley High School in Las Vegas in 1984, he instilled a firm foundation that would anchor Maddux’s future career.</p><h2>Greg Maddux Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Greg Maddux is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from United States.

At the time, Maddux was the youngest player in the majors. His first appearance in a major league game was as a pinch runner (for catcher Jody Davis) in the 17th inning against the Houston Astros. Maddux then pitched in the 18th inning, allowing a home run to Billy Hatcher and taking the loss. His first start, five days later, was a complete game win. In his fifth and final start of 1986, Maddux defeated his older brother, who was pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies, marking the first time rookie brothers had pitched against each other. Mike Maddux was well used to his younger brother’s competitive spirit, saying of their youth, “If Greg couldn’t win, he didn’t want to play, plain and simple.”</p><p>In 1987, his first full season in the majors, Maddux struggled to a 6–14 record and 5.61 ERA, but he flourished in 1988, finishing 18–8 with a 3.18 ERA.
