During the game, Martinez passed former Heisman winner Eric Crouch as the all-time leader in total yardage at Nebraska.</p><p>Leading up to the 2012 season, Martinez was heavily criticized by fans and media for his awkward passing motion and tendency to turn the ball over. During the spring and summer of 2012, Martinez spent time working on his throwing motion with Steve Calhoun, a private quarterback’s coach that operates a football camp in California called “Armed and Dangerous.” Calhoun was known for his work with college quarterbacks, and had helped prepare some college quarterbacks for the NFL, including Cam Newton and Jake Locker. Although Martinez had only completed 56% of his passes in 2011, he was confident that his second season as quarterback for in Tim Beck’s offense would be better.
