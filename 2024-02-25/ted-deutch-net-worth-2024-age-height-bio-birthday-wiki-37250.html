He won the Democratic primary with 85% of the vote, and on April 13, 2010, won the special election, defeating Republican Edward J. Lynch.</p><p align=justify>In December 2015, Florida underwent redistricting due to a Supreme Court ruling. Most of Deutch’s territory became the 22nd District, and was pushed further into Broward County. In the process, it absorbed the portion of Broward County that had previously been in the neighboring 22nd District of fellow Democrat Lois Frankel, which had been renumbered as the 21st District. This came after the state supreme court suggested it was better to have only one district splitting the two counties. After the new lines were announced, Deutch announced he would run in the new 22nd. Although the new lines put his home near Boca Raton just inside the borders of the 21st, members of Congress are only required to live in the state they wish to represent. In a statement, Deutch stressed his longstanding ties to Broward County, which accounted for 80 percent of the reconfigured district. He’d represented much of the Broward County portion of the district for a decade at the federal and state levels. The Sun Sentinel also noted that staying in a Broward-based district would increase Deutch’s statewide and national profile by allowing him to advertise on Miami/Fort Lauderdale television.</p><h2>Who is Ted Deutch Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ted Deutch</strong> married to <strong>Jill Weinstock </strong>.
