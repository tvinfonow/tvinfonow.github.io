Who is Zhenli Ye Gon dating now & how much money does Zhenli Ye Gon have?</p><h2>Zhenli Ye Gon Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Zhenli Ye Gon</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Drug Lord</strong> who was born on <strong>January 31, 1963</strong> in Shanghai, <strong>China</strong>. Zhenli Ye, a Chinese-Mexican businessman, was born January 31, 1963 in Shanghai. He is currently being investigated for trafficking ephedrine and ephedrine precursor chemical into Mexico from Asia.&nbsp;Unimed Pharm Chem Mexico’s owner, he is also the legal representative for various Mexican corporations.&nbsp;As part of its extensive importation business, Unimed was legally allowed by the Mexican government from 2002 to 2004 to import thousands of tonnes of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and other products into Mexico.&nbsp;The pseudoephedrines and ephedrine were used widely in over-the counter cold medicines such as Sudafed. However, they could also be used for methamphetamine manufacturers.</p><p>Mexican authorities claim that Ye Gon’s money was the result of drug-trafficking operations.&nbsp;Ye Gon claims that Javier Lozano Alarcon (secretariat of labor and social welfare), forced him to keep the money at his house and that it would be used for Felipe Calderon’s presidential campaign in 2006.&nbsp;Felipe Calderon said that Ye Gon invented the money to avoid being charged.&nbsp;This explanation is supported by a Georgetown University Professor of Latin American Studies Mark Chernick’s expert report in Ye Gon’s habeas corpus matter. It was based on Latin America’s history of “clientelism”, run by party bosses, as well as the closeness of Mexico’s 2006 Presidential election.</p><p>The police raid of Ye Gon’s home and businesses in Mexico, on March 15, 2007, took place one day after a high-level meeting occurred between U.S. President George W. Bush and Mexican President Felipe Calderon in the Mexican city of Mérida on March 14, 2007, at which both Presidents announced plans to expand bilateral and regional counter-narcotics and security cooperation. Later, on October 22, 2007, the U.S. and Mexico jointly announced their “Merida Initiative,” named after this city where both Presidents had met. The Mérida Initiative involved a multi-year plan in which the U.S. would provide significant financial assistance to the Mexican government, plus smaller amounts to other Latin American countries, to help them combat drug trafficking and other organizations. Pursuant to this $1.1 billion announced Mérida Initiative, the Bush Administration eventually requested $500 million for Mexico in supplemental FY2008 appropriations, plus another $450 million for Mexico in its FY2009 budget request. [2]</p><p>The fortune, reportedly found by the police on March 15, 2007 at his residence at Lomas de Chapultepec in Mexico City included the following:</p><p align=justify>The Unimed audits between 2002 and 2006 by Mexican officials showed no evidence of improper diversion or other improprieties.&nbsp;However, Unimed’s license for import of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine products was terminated on July 1, 2005. It was claimed that Ye Gon and some employees continued to import four unapproved containers of pseudoephedrine/ephedrine precursor chemical into Mexico in late 2005 or 2006.&nbsp;Only 4 of the 291 Unimed shipments from Canada, China England, Germany, Israel and Hong Kong to Mexico were ever questioned.&nbsp;The U.S. government indicted the four Mexican shipments as part of a conspiracy to aid the US’s methamphetamine importation.&nbsp;In August 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the U.S. case with prejudice.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Zhenli Ye Gon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Zhenli</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drug Lord</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 31</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shanghai</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>China</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Zhenli Ye Gon ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

On December 5 United Pharm Chem had seen 19,497 kilos of a product that Mexican authorities claimed contained a controlled precursor chemical seized. Other individuals affiliated with his companies and the challenged importations were also arrested. On July 9, 2010, however, defendant Juan Llaca Diaz was declared innocent in a Mexican court, and acquitted of organized crime and drug charges. Mexico’s Judiciary Council issued a statement noting that prosecutors had failed to prove key parts of their case, including that the substance seized was a psychotropic or narcotic drug. 2012, two brothers of Ye Gon, who had been arrested shortly after the initial seizures in 2007, were also ordered released from custody by the Mexican courts. [1] In more than six years since the original seizures and arrests, no person affiliated with any of these events has yet been convicted of any crime, either in the U.S. or in Mexico.</p><h2>Zhenli Ye Gon Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Zhenli Ye Gon is one of the <strong>richest Drug Lord</strong> from China. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Zhenli Ye Gon</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Ye Gon has denied that he is a member the Sinaloa Cartel.&nbsp;Before these allegations of wrongdoing, he was a Mexican citizen in 2002.</p><p align=justify>Although Unimed was accused of illegally importing four shipments of ephedrine precursors during 2005-06, Unimed still owned, in March 2006, 9.806 metric tonnes of finished pseudophedrine products. These had been legal imported in 2004, but were still in Unimed’s warehouse.&nbsp;This large amount of pseudoephedrine was sold with Mexican officials’ consent.&nbsp;Ye Gon’s attorneys pointed out that Unimed was allegedly importing unfinished pseudoephedrine product while it still had almost 10 metric tonnes of finished pseudoephedrine. These products had been sitting idle for years and could have been diverted if criminal activities were contemplated.&nbsp;They also pointed out that none of the four challenged shipments contained pseudoephedrine, ephedrine precursors. Additionally, Bernardo Mercado Jiminez (Mexico’s government-approved chemist) stated that he didn’t know that imported substances were illegal under Mexican law and that he advised Ye Gon who is not a chemist that the illegal substances were legal chemicals that are not restricted or controlled under Mexican law.</p><p align=justify>Two Mexican Federal agents who were involved in the arrests at the Zhenli Ye Gon mansion were found dead in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero, as reported on August 2, 2007. Ye Gon was not among the persons who had been arrested by these agents several months before, however, and no charges have ever been filed suggesting any link whatsoever between their deaths and Ye Gon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Drug Lord</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In March 2007, the Mexican government entered Ye Gon’s home and seized hundreds of millions of dollars in cash. In an interview with the news agency AP, Ye Gon explained he agreed to keep the money in his home after his life, as well as those of his family, were threatened by members of Mexico’s PAN party.</p><p>In 2007, Zhenli Ye Gon was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia with a single count of conspiracy to aid and abet the manufacture of 500&nbsp;grams or more of methamphetamine, knowing or intending that it would be imported into the United States. Federal agents arrested him in a Wheaton, Maryland restaurant on July 23, 2007. From the date of his arrest, Ye Gon has always maintained that he is not guilty. Prior to the Mexican government’s enforcement actions, Ye Gon was openly building a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical plant in Toluca, Mexico, and in his federal court proceedings, the U.S. prosecutor referred to Ye Gon as “a very sophisticated businessman.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Zhenli Ye Gon height</b> Not available right now.

Ye Gon was said to be in the U.S. as he was supposedly spotted in Las Vegas at the moment of the seizure of the cash and in New York City afterwards. He was arrested without incident at a restaurant in Wheaton, Maryland on July 24, 2007.</p><p align=justify>Ye Gon was scheduled to go to trial on his U.S. charge in September 2009. On June 22, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss its case against Ye Gon, citing Mexico’s interests as well as evidentiary concerns. At a hearing on the same day, prosecutors admitted that one of their key witnesses had recanted. His criminal defense attorneys, Manuel J. Retureta, of Retureta & Wassem, PLLC, and A. Eduardo Balarezo vigorously litigated this Brady issue before the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan. As a result of the efforts of Messrs. Retureta and Balarezo, all charges brought against Ye Gon by the government of the United States were dismissed with prejudice on August 28, 2009. Judge Sullivan also noted how “this court made numerous inquiries of government counsel as to just what the status of the requests were to get drug samples for testing purposes, to provide evidence for the prosecution, and basically … Mexico just snubbed the United States.”</p><h2>Who is Zhenli Ye Gon Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Zhenli Ye Gon</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

You may help us to build the dating records for Zhenli Ye Gon!<p>In his habeas petition, Ye Gon has argued that in light of the U.S. case’s dismissal, his extradition is barred by principles of international double jeopardy (non bis in idem). In light of Government admissions that “Mexico has not set out to prove … that Ye Gon mass produced methamphetamine itself,” Ye Gon has also claimed that extradition is improper under the legal requirement of dual criminality (since the alleged precursor chemicals imported into Mexico are not controlled substances in the U.S.), and other barriers. The petition also notes how many of Mexico’s allegations of wrongdoing underlying the extradition request come from statements made by disgruntled and/or fired former employees of Unimed, and that the Mexican arrest warrant’s listed “main accomplice” of Ye Gon has since recanted. In addition, the key Mexican prosecutors responsible for Mexico’s charges against Ye Gon have themselves since left office. Jorge Joaqin Diaz Lopez, the lead prosecutor who swore out and presented Ye Gon’s Mexican arrest warrant, submitted a “voluntary irrevocable resignation” in January 2009, following a Mexican anti-corruption initiative known as Operacion Limpieza (“Operation Clean-Up), although Mexico continues to claim that Diaz resigned for personal reasons. Diaz’s boss at the time, Noe Ramirez Mandujano – who served as the head of Mexico’s national organized crime unit – was himself later criminally charged and jailed in November 2008, after allegedly receiving $500,000 in exchange for providing sensitive information to drug cartels in Mexico. Zhenli Ye Gon was extradited to Mexico in October 2016.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Zhenli Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Drug Lord</strong>.
