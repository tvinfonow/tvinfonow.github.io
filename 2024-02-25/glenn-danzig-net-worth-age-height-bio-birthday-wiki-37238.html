Singer-songwriter best known as the frontman for the seminal punk rock band Misfits. He has also had a solo career under the moniker Danzig. He began his own comic book label, Verotik.</p><p>He was at one point replaced by <a href=#>Michale Graves</a> as the lead singer of Misfits.</p><p>In the mid-1970s, Danzig started the Misfits, releasing the band’s records through his own label, (originally known as Blank, then later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, only to be told that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band’s name comes from Marilyn Monroe’s last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a “social misfit.” In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: “It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren’t prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn’t seem to have the same outlook. So it was time for me to move on.”</p><p>Beginning in the mid-1970s, Danzig’s musical career has encompassed a number of genres through the years, including punk rock, heavy metal, industrial, blues and classical music. He has also written songs for other musicians, most notably Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison.</p><p align=justify>His father was a Marine Corps veteran who served in World War II and the Korean War and his mother worked at a record store, which prompted his love for music.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glenn Danzig</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glenn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Danzig</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Punk Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lodi</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Glenn Danzig ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The origins of Samhain began when Danzig started rehearsing with Eerie Von, formerly of Rosemary’s Babies. Danzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year, which influenced the evolution of the modern Halloween. Initially Samhain was conceived as a punk rock “super group”. The band briefly featured members of Minor Threat and Reagan Youth, who contributed to Samhain’s 1984 debut, Initium. The band then settled with a lineup consisting of Eerie Von on bass, Damien on guitar, and Steve Zing on drums (later replaced by London May). In 1985 the Unholy Passion EP was released, followed by November-Coming-Fire in 1986.</p><h2>Glenn Danzig Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Glenn Danzig is one of the <strong>richest Punk Singer</strong> from United States.

Rick Rubin, music producer and head of the Def American label, would see the band perform at the 1986 New Music Seminar, on the advice of then-Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Danzig has credited both Burton and Metallica frontman James Hetfield with helping to raise awareness about his music: “I first met them at a Black Flag gig, and then we became kinda friends. We’d often bump into each other on the road…James and Cliff helped to spread the word about me, and I was very grateful to them.”</p><p>In 1987, Danzig, owing to his association with Rubin, was asked to write a song for Roy Orbison. The result was “Life Fades Away”, featured in the 1987 movie Less than Zero. Danzig also contributed to the film’s soundtrack with “You and Me (Less than Zero)”. Danzig had originally been asked to write the song for a female vocalist, but when Rubin could not find a suitable singer Danzig recorded the vocals himself. The song is credited to “Glenn Danzig and the Power Fury Orchestra”, which featured the same membership as the initial lineup of Danzig, with the exception of Eerie Von. Since Von did not like the way producer Rubin wanted the bass played on the song, George Drakoulias played the bass instead.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Glenn Danzig height</b> <strong>5 ft 3 in</strong> Glenn <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Danzig graduated from Lodi High School in June 1973, aspiring to become a comic book creator and professional photographer.
