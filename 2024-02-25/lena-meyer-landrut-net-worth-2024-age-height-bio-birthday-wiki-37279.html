Germany’s entry in the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest who won with her song “Satellite.”&nbsp;Album debut My Cassette Player, was a top-selling album.</p><p>She as well as&nbsp;She and <a href=#>Elena Paparizou</a> were both finalists in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest.&nbsp;were both finalist for the year 2011 Eurovision Song Contest.</p><p>Lena Johanna Therese Meyer-Landrut (German: [ˈleːna] ; born 23 May 1991), also known by the mononym Lena, is a German singer-songwriter. She rose to fame after representing Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, winning the contest with her song “Satellite”. Both “Satellite” and her debut album My Cassette Player (2010) debuted at number one in Germany and became platinum sellers. With her three entries from the German national final Unser Star für Oslo, Meyer-Landrut set an all-time chart record in her home country by debuting with three songs in the top five of the German Singles Chart. She represented Germany for the second consecutive time in the Eurovision Song Contest at Düsseldorf in 2011 with the song “Taken by a Stranger”, placing tenth.</p><p>Representing a “big four” country, Meyer-Landrut automatically qualified for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. Germany received a wild card during the running order draw, allowing the German representatives to choose the country’s position for the final. They chose position 22 out of the 25 spots. Meyer-Landrut arrived in Oslo one week before the show and completed five rehearsals of her song “Satellite”. Before the final, she was considered one of the favourites. Bookmakers regarded her as the second favourite behind Azerbaijan’s Safura, while Google projected she would win based on search volume in the participating countries. According to Norway’s Aftenposten she received the most media attention of all the participants. The final was held on 29 May 2010 at Oslo’s Telenor Arena. Appearing fourth from last, Meyer-Landrut wore a simple black dress and performed on a bare stage with four backing singers. Her pared-back presentation was a break from recent Eurovision trends, as it did not feature any choreography, dancers or an elaborate stage show. “Satellite” received a total of 246 points, giving Germany its first win since 1982, and the first victory as a unified country. The song won over Turkey’s entry “We Could Be the Same” with a margin of 76 points, the second largest in Eurovision history, second only to Alexander Rybak’s margin of 169 points in the 2009 contest. (It would later be eclipsed by Loreen’s victory in 2012, sporting a margin of 113 points). “Satellite” was awarded the maximum of 12 points nine times and received points from all but five countries. The BBC called “Satellite” the first “contemporary pop hit Eurovision has produced in decades,” ushering in “a new era for the annual music jamboree”. Meyer-Landrut’s victory received much attention in Germany and the show was seen by 15 million viewers on German television (a 49.1 percent market share). She returned to Hanover the following day, where she was greeted by 40,000 people. In June, “Satellite” regained the top spot on the German singles chart for one week and also peaked at number one in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. It also topped the European Hot 100 singles chart—the first Eurovision song to do so.</p><p align=justify>The place she was raised was Hanover, Germany.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lena Meyer-Landrut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lena</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Meyer-Landrut</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1991</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hanover</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ladislas Meyer-Landrut, Daniela Meyer-Landrut</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Lena Meyer-Landrut ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. From 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she said, “I like to test myself. I wanted to see how I am perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can’t judge myself at all.” After her first appearance, performing “My Same” by British singer Adele, Meyer-Landrut received much praise from the show’s jury panel and was instantly considered the favourite. The following week, Adele’s “My Same” entered the German singles chart at number 61. Meyer-Landrut reached the final of Unser Star für Oslo, mainly performing lesser-known songs by international artists The Bird and the Bee, Kate Nash, Paolo Nutini and Lisa Mitchell. Of her eight cover performances, five of the original songs subsequently charted in Germany, with all but “Foundations” reaching their peak chart position. In the final, on 12 March 2010, Meyer-Landrut sang three songs specifically written for the contest, “Bee”, “Satellite” and “Love Me”. Through televoting the audience chose “Satellite”, written by American Julie Frost and Dane John Gordon, to be her designated song in the event she won the show. In a second round of voting Meyer-Landrut was chosen as Germany’s entry for the 55th Eurovision Song Contest, beating the last remaining contestant, Jennifer Braun.</p><h2>Lena Meyer-Landrut Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Lena Meyer-Landrut is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from Germany.
