Johnson and Hernandez both claimed no compensation was arranged and the transaction was a kind gesture between teammates and nothing more.

Singleton, who later paid Hernandez back $120,000 for the loan.</p><h3>What happened with Aaron Hernandez?</h3><p>He was convicted of Lloyd’s murder and sentenced to life in prison; he was acquitted of the double homicide in April 2017 but days later was <b>found dead in his prison cell after hanging himself with a bedsheet</b>.</p><h3>What bad things did Aaron Hernandez do?</h3><p>In 2015, he was convicted to life in prison for the <b>murder of Lloyd</b>.
