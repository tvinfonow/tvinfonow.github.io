However, the supposed cast denied the reports as baseless and P. Vasu postponed the film, citing a delay in production. Later in April 2017, Vasu revealed that he still had intentions of making the film if he found a producer to help finance the project. Similarly in early 2014, P. Vasu released an official statement claiming that his next film would be an animatronics venture titled Aishwaryavum Aayiram Kaakkavum and that Aishwarya Rai would feature in the leading role. Aishwarya Rai’s team later denied claims citing that such allegations of an agreement were premature.
