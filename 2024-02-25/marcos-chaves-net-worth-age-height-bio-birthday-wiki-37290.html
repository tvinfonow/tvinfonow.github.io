Marcos Chaves had numerous solo and group exhibitions at Brazil’s most important art institutions and biennials, including the Museum of Art of Rio, Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro (MAR), Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro (MAC), CCBB Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil (CCBB), 1st and 5th Biennials of Mercosul Portalo Alegre and the 25th International Biennial of Sao Paulo.</p><p>Marcos Chaves’ art practice evolved over the years through a variety of projects and works that span across media and mediums. These include text, sound, video installations, assemblages and photography, as well as site-specific projects.&nbsp;Chaves is most well-known and easily recognized by his gestures of appropriation, intervention and other means. He searches for new meanings or manipulates the existing ones that are inherent to objects, words, and life-situations.&nbsp;His work is a collection of poetry that extracts poetry from ordinary objects, landscapes, and words.</p><p>Upon his return to Brazil in 1985, he met Leonilson&nbsp;[pt] , a major artist in the Brazilian scene with whom he began a regular dialogue about art. Together they experimented with four-hands paintings. During this period, Chaves developed a studio practice and started working on his first assemblages and object-based works, shifting his interest from painting to what has shaped his current conceptual, language and text-based, and photographic practice.</p><p>Marcos Chaves’ most notable photographic work, Eu só vendo a vista (1997), takes as its main subject Rio de Janeiro’s iconic view of the Sugar Loaf mountain found on tourist postcards and collectively associated to the landscape of the city. This view, shot from a very traditional angle becomes almost invisible for having been overly represented and used.</p><p align=justify>The words Vai Passar are written on the flag.&nbsp;Will this pass?&nbsp;This is a direct reference the title of a Chico Buarque song written in 1980 under military dictatorship.&nbsp;The flag is made from a shiny green and pink fabric. It refers to Brazil’s first Samba School, Mangueira.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marcos Chaves</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marcos</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chaves</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Artist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rio de Janeiro</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brazil</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Marcos Chaves ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It is an ongoing cartographic and archival project about the city, photography, sculpture and street interventions—all at once. A map of the city could be generated from this methodical archive, resembling the process of an urban anthropologist, extracting meaning and sense from the city’s urban fabric and the way its users inhabit it or fill its holes…</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Marcos Chaves height</b> Not available right now.

Still, the mask has the potential of absorbing many of the issues that arouse the interest of the art territory in its modern acceptation: illusion, myth, allegory and simulacrum. In an even broader sphere, the mask touches the true/false dichotomy, a dilemma that, since Plato, has substantiated the aesthetic universe. The figure of the mask is not extraneous to the work of Marcos Chaves, and this has already been observed in the interventions that he carried out at Castelinho do Flamengo in 2000 when, using make-up, false eyelashes and other adornments, he transformed the eclectic-style sculptures into lively and hilarious images, like transvestites. There, he effected a deviation of the static nature of the statues, updating and ironizing the obsolete character of academic art, in addition to underscoring how much from eclecticism – which transits amidst various styles – was appropriated by the post-modern world.<br>—Ligia Canongia</p><h2>Who is Marcos Chaves Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Marcos Chaves</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
