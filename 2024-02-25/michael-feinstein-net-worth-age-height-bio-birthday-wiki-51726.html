Through the widow of concert pianist-actor Oscar Levant, in 1977 he was introduced to Ira Gershwin, who hired him to catalogue his extensive collection of phonograph records. The assignment led to six years of researching, cataloguing and preserving the unpublished sheet music and rare recordings in Gershwin’s home, thus building an archive of not just Ira’s works but also those of his composer brother George Gershwin, who had died four decades earlier. During Feinstein’s years with Gershwin, he also got to know Gershwin’s next-door neighbor, singer Rosemary Clooney, with whom Feinstein formed a close friendship lasting until Clooney’s death.
