Its first single, “I Was Made for Dancin'”, reached number 10 on the US Hot 100 and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart early in 1979. It became his greatest hit in the US and the UK.

You may help us to build the dating records for Leif Garrett!<p>In December 1984, Los Angeles Superior Court ordered Garrett’s insurers, Transamerica Insurance Co., to pay $3.9&nbsp;million to Winkler. Jurors assessed total damages in the civil negligence case at $4,215,500, but subtracted 8% of that amount, or $337,240, on the grounds that Winkler contributed to his own injuries by agreeing to ride in a car with a driver who he knew was drunk. Both Garrett and Winkler admitted in court that they were drunk and had taken depressant drugs; the court heard they had each taken equal amounts of alcohol and drugs that night. The panel ordered Garrett to pay $15,000 in punitive damages, which was not diminished by Winkler’s partial responsibility. Winkler’s attorney, Edward Steinbrecher, attributed the relatively small punitive damage award to Garrett’s testimony that his net worth was only $50,000 to $100,000. In 1987 Winkler settled for $6&nbsp;million with the Premier Insurance Co., which had insured the firm leasing the Porsche to Garrett’s mother. Garrett and Winkler were reunited in 1999 for an episode of Behind the Music, where Garrett was relieved to learn that Winkler had no ill feelings towards him and even said that Garrett’s actions following the accident had actually saved his life. The two remained in contact until Winkler’s death in 2017.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Leif Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular TV Actor</strong>.
