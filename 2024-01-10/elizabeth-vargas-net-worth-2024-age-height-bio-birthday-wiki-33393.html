In June 1996, she joined ABC’s Good Morning America as the newsreader and Joan Lunden’s likely “heir apparent”. In June 1997, ABC promoted Vargas to primetime magazine show correspondent, succeeded by Kevin Newman as newsreader. In 2002, she was one of the anchors for 20/20 Downtown, which was later rebranded Downtown before being rebranded again in 2003 as Primetime Monday before its end. She later reported occasionally for Primetime. She was also named anchor of World News Tonight Saturday and presented with the opportunity to develop specials for primetime. In November 2003, Vargas became anchor of World News Tonight Sunday. She was named co-anchor of 20/20 in May 2004.</p><p>Vargas was the first national evening news anchor of Puerto Rican and Irish-American heritage and also the third female anchor of a network evening newscast in the U.S. since Connie Chung and Barbara Walters. She is said to be particularly proud of an ABC special report in which she questioned why the Laci Peterson case merited more attention than two other similar cases, one involving a black woman and the other involving a Hispanic woman. Another story she did, based on the book The Da Vinci Code and the role of Mary Magdalene, helped fuel a nationwide religious debate. Vargas stated that for centuries Mary Magdalene has been portrayed as a prostitute by the church despite evidence to the contrary. She went on to question the strictly limited role of women within the church. In 1999, she won an Emmy Award for her coverage of the Elián González story, and in 1998 she was nominated for an Emmy Award for her 20/20 investigation into the wrongful conviction of Betty Tyson.</p><p align=justify>She has two children with her husband.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elizabeth Vargas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elizabeth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vargas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paterson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Anne Vargas, Rafael Vargas</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marc Cohn</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Zachary Raphael Cohn, Samuel Wyatt Cohn</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Elizabeth Vargas ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Gibson was then named sole anchor of the show, effective from May&nbsp;29, 2006, replacing Vargas and Woodruff. To explain the sudden change, Vargas cited her doctors’ recommendation to cut back her schedule considerably owing to a difficult pregnancy and her wish to spend more time with her new baby when he arrived. Most “inside accounts”, however, said she fully expected and wished to return to the anchor chair soon after giving birth, but Gibson threatened to quit ABC News if he was not made sole permanent anchor.
