The Rangers acquired young starter Brandon McCarthy in exchange for the even younger John Danks.</p><p>Another trade Daniels made was sending Laynce Nix, Kevin Mench, and Francisco Cordero to the Milwaukee Brewers for minor leaguer Nelson Cruz, and All-star left fielder Carlos Lee. The trade was completed just before the trade deadline of the 2006 season. Lee was the most sought after trade target during the season and provided the Rangers with a strong bat in the middle of the lineup. Lee then signed a $100 million free agent contract with the Houston Astros, giving the Rangers the #17 and #35 draft picks in 2007 (Blake Beavan and Julio Borbon, respectively) as compensation. Cruz emerged as a power-hitting All-Star in the 2009 season for the Rangers, and became a mainstay in the lineup during the World Series years.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jon Daniels height</b> Not available right now.

While Otsuka filled a valuable role as the Rangers closer, the oft-injured Eaton only pitched 65 innings with an ERA of 5.12. Dallas-native Chris Young pitched 180 innings for the Padres, racking up 164 Kâ€™s and posting an ERA of 3.46. AdriÃ¡n GonzÃ¡lez (considered a prized prospect) batted .304 for the Padres while hitting 24 home runs. This is generally considered the worst move of Danielsâ€™ career.</p><p align=justify>As a result of the 2007 draft, trades and Latin America free agent signings, the Rangers jumped to the #4 system in Baseball America 2008 organization rankings.
