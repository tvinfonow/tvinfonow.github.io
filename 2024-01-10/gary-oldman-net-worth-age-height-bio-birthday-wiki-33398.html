His older sister, Maureen, is an actress better known as Laila Morse; she would go on to have a role in Oldman’s directorial debut Nil by Mouth (1997), before taking on her most famous role of Mo Harris in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell’s performance in the film The Raging Moon (1971). In a 1995 interview with Charlie Rose, he said, “Something about Malcolm just arrested me, and I connected, and I said, ‘I wanna do that.'” Growing up in south London, Oldman supported his local football club, Millwall, but also followed Manchester United because he idolised George Best. In 2011, he learned from his mother that his father represented Millwall after World War II: “Just after the war, [my mother] ran a boarding house for football players—Millwall players. And I knew that my dad was involved somehow with the reserve team. But two weeks ago my mum said, ‘Oh yeah, your dad played for Millwall.

He rose to prominence in British film with his portrayals of Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy (1986), Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987), and Rosencrantz in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990) while also garnering attention as the leader of a gang of football hooligans in the controversial television film The Firm (1989).

In 1979, he starred in Thark, opposite Annette Kerr, at York’s Theatre Royal. Subsequent plays included Cabaret, Privates on Parade and Romeo and Juliet. In December 1979, Oldman appeared as Puss in Dick Whittington and His Cat, staged at York.

Max Stafford-Clark, artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, had seen Oldman’s performance and cast him as Scopey, the lead role of Bond’s The Pope’s Wedding, in 1984. For his acclaimed performance, he won two of British theatre’s top honours: the Time Out Fringe Award for Best Newcomer, and the Drama Theatre Award for Best Actor—the latter of which was shared with future film co-star Anthony Hopkins for his performance in Pravda. Oldman’s turn in The Pope’s Wedding led to a run of work with the Royal Court, and from 1984 to 1986 he appeared in Rat in the Skull (Ron Hutchinson), The Desert Air (Nicholas Wright), Cain and Abel, The Danton Affair (Pam Gems), Women Beware Women (Thomas Middleton), Real Dreams (Trevor Griffiths) and all three of Bond’s The War Plays: Red Black and Ignorant, The Tin Can People and Great Peace.

He twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: “I wasn’t really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I’d never followed it. It wasn’t something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and ‘who cares’ and ‘why bother’ and all of that. And I was a little bit sort-of with my nose in the air and sort-of thinking ‘well the theatre – so much more superior’ and all of that.” He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent. In 1987, Oldman gained his third starring film role as Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears, for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor. That same year, he appeared in the plays The Country Wife (William Wycherley) and Serious Money (Caryl Churchill).
