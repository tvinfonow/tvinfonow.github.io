Stewart J. Friesen (born July 25 1983) is a Canadian professional stock car race driver.&nbsp;He currently races full-time on the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series in the No.&nbsp;52 Toyota Tundra for Halmar Friesen Racing.&nbsp;He also participates in part-time races on track tracks that are local to New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, driving the number.&nbsp;44 for HFR.</p><p>in 2014 Friesen was interviewed by ESPN where he stated that Stewart utilized his vehicle as an “weapon” when Stewart killed Kevin Ward Jr. in an accident on the dirt track.</p><p>On January 9, 2017, Friesen announced that he would run the full 2017 season in the Halmar Friesen Racing No. 52 with Tommy Baldwin Jr. coming on as a team manager. In June, following the first seven races of the season, HFR announced it would undergo a two-race hiatus before returning at Kentucky in July. At Eldora, Friesen won the pole and stayed in the position for the start of the feature after winning his heat race. He led over half the laps and claimed the victory in the second stage but lost the lead to Matt Crafton in the closing laps, finishing a career-best second. About a month after Eldora run, the team took another two-race break while severing its relationship with Baldwin and making a new technical alliance with GMS Racing. After returning to competition, Friesen scored four finishes of seventh or better in the season’s last six races, climbing to fourteenth in the season-ending points tally.</p><p>For 2018, HFR continued the alliance with GMS, so much so that GMS driver Johnny Sauter referenced Friesen as a teammate. After advancing to the playoffs and a best finish of 2nd 3 times throughout the year, he finished 7th in final points after being eliminated in the Round of 8.</p><p align=justify>(key) (Bold (key) Bold position is awarded through qualifying time.&nbsp;Italics indicate the position that was earned from points standings or by practice time.&nbsp;* – Most laps led. )</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stewart Friesen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stewart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Friesen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Racing Driver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1983</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Niagara-on-the-Lake</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jessica Friesen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stewart Friesen ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
