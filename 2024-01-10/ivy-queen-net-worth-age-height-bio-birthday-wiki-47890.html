Puerto Rican singer who sang the hit track “Quiero bailar.” She won multiple awards for her hit single “Dime,” including Urban Song of the Year.</p><p>She has collaborated with <a href=#>Wyclef Jean</a>.</p><p>When she was 18, Ivy Queen moved to San Juan, where she met rapper and producer DJ Negro. In 1995, Queen joined an all-male Puerto Rican group called the Noise, at the invitation of DJ Negro. The group became part of the emerging reggaeton scene. DJ Negro began producing a series of CDs centered around the Noise. Ivy Queen made her first appearance on the fifth installment of the CD series on a track called “Somos Raperos Pero No Delincuentes”. She became tired of the violent and sexual themes often used in reggaeton, and wished to write about a wider variety of subjects.</p><p>DJ Negro convinced Queen to go solo, and in 1997 she recorded her first solo album, En Mi Imperio—which featured the hit single “Como Mujer”—for Sony Discos. In 1998, Queen launched her second album, The Original Rude Girl—which featured Don Chezina, Alex D’Castro, and Domingo Quiñones— and worked with Wyclef Jean on her debut single “In the Zone”. The album is bilingual and features hip hop music, a departure from the reggaeton featured on her debut album. The Original Rude Girl was commercially unsuccessful but “In The Zone” charted at number 38 on the Billboard Rhythmic Top 40.</p><p align=justify>She has a daughter named Naiovy Kháli Star Sánchez. She was previously married to Gran Omar, and she dated DJ Urba.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ivy Queen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ivy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Queen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reggaeton Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Puerto Rico</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Francisco Pesante, Santa Rodríguez</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Xavier Sánchez , Gran Omar</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Naiovy Kháli Star Sánchez</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ivy Queen ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

After the success of the album—which was certified platinum by the RIAA, Ivy Queen released a platinum edition of Diva in 2004. The platinum edition was nominated for “Reggaeton Album of the Year” at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards. “Quiero Bailar”, the album’s lead single, became the first Spanish-language track to reach number one on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart of Miami’s WPOW—an American radio station that does not usually play Spanish music.</p><h2>Ivy Queen Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ivy Queen is one of the <strong>richest Reggaeton Singer</strong> from United States.

She first gained attention as a member of the Noise in Puerto Rico. There, she performed her first song “Somos Raperos Pero No Delincuentes” (We are Rappers, Not Delinquents). Queen went solo in 1996, and released her debut studio album En Mi Imperio (In My Empire) which was quickly picked up by Sony Discos for distribution in 1997.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reggaeton Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>She later released The Original Rude Girl, her second studio album for Sony label, which spawned the hit single “In the Zone”. However, Ivy Queen did not rise to fame until she moved to an independent record label to release her third studio album, Diva in 2003. Queen’s albums Diva, Flashback, and Sentimiento have all been awarded Gold and Platinum record status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her seventh studio album Drama Queen was released in 2010, and spawned a top ten single “La Vida es Así”. It was followed by the Grammy Award-nominated Musa in 2012. Queen’s recordings often include themes of female empowerment, infidelity, and relationships, and she is often referred to as the Queen of Reggaeton.</p><p>Queen’s fourth studio album, Real, was originally planned to be her first full-length English language album after she received contract offers from several record labels—including Sony. Queen said that it was a good opportunity to reach other markets, and in particular the competitive market of English rap. Sony’s offer to record an English-language album came after they noticed that her previous Sony albums were being heard in London, thanks to the success of Diva. The album included collaborations with artists including Fat Joe, La India, Héctor Delgado, and Getto & Gastam. American hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz produced the track “Soldados”. The album was released on November 16, 2004, and spawneed the Top 10 single “Dile” which was nominated for “Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ivy Queen height</b> <strong>5 feet 4 inches</strong> Ivy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 4 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1999, after a lack of commercial success with her first two studio albums, Sony dropped Queen and she took a break from her musical career. In 2001 and 2002, Queen’s music began appearing on reggaeton compilation albums, spawning hits like “Quiero Bailar” from The Majestic 2 and “Quiero Saber” from Kilates. With songs like “Quire Bailar”, Ivy Queen represented women “In a movement that took off commercially [and dominantly was led by men] with aggressively lyrics and a “doggiestyle perreo dance”. Ivy Queen established herself as reggaeton’s no-nonsense female conscience. (Her anthem “Quiero Baliar” warned her dance partner not to misinterpret those moves.)”. In 2003, Queen and her then-husband Gran Omar signed with independent, Miami-based label Real Music, established by Jorge Guadalupe and Anthony Pérez. They appeared on the label’s first album Jams Vol. 1. Queen frequently appeared and performed on the reggaeton television show “The Roof”, which featured urban music and lifestyle, and was produced by Pérez.</p><p align=justify>Queen has also recorded salsa tracks, beginning in 2005 with “Amiga No Pienses” and “Yo Lamento”, and in 2007 with “Si Eres Tú” which she recorded in a “big-band Salsa” style. She worked with salsa singers La India on “Cuando Hieres A Una Mujer” and Víctoria Sanabría on “No Te Quiero”. Ivy Queen cites Celia Cruz, La Lupe, and other “classic Salsa singers” as inspirations for her style of hip-hop music. Her main influence is Selena, to whom she pays tribute on her fifth studio album Flashback with a “reggaeton-ed up twist” on “Si Una Vez”. She also said she enjoyed the songs “Como La Flor” and “La Carcacha”. Queen told Ramiro Burr of the Houston Chronicle, “I admired Selena because she had that famous crossover success, but sadly she never got to enjoy it,” she said. According to Allmusic, she takes influences from Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Gloria Estefan, Madonna and Salt-N-Pepa. Queen cites American rapper Missy Elliott as an influence as well. Reggaetón duo Jowell & Randy cite Queen as one of their musical influences. Queen is also a musical influence for Colombian singer Farina Dominican singer Natti Natasha, Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and American rappers Bia and Cardi B.</p><h2>Who is Ivy Queen Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ivy Queen</strong> married to <strong>Xavier Sánchez , Gran Omar </strong>.

Queen said she never found Omar in the act of adultery, and said that if she had, she would be in La Vega Alta—a women’s prison in Puerto Rico. She also said she had not physically assaulted Omar’s alleged mistress. She stated they had not lived together for two months, citing the “extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer” as causes of the end of the nine-year marriage. A year after their separation, Omar said that Queen had tricked him, and that she owed him money from the sales and production of the album Cosa Nostra: Hip-Hop, which they presented together because of their obligations and contract with Univision. Jorge Guadalupe—Ivy Queen’s manager—invited Omar to take legal action. Guadalupe called Omar “someone who misses the money and the high-life” he had while he was married to Queen. No legal action was taken, however. Omar appeared on television station Telefutura’s program Escándalo TV and accused Queen of being unfaithful in their marriage. Queen however, denied the claims.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ivy Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Reggaeton Singer</strong>.

This ensured that the album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product. Queen’s first compilation album The Best of Ivy Queen, consisting of tracks from Diva and Real, was released the same year. On October 29, 2005, she released Flashback, which contained the singles “Cuéntale”, “Libertad”, and “Te He Querido, Te He Llorado”.
