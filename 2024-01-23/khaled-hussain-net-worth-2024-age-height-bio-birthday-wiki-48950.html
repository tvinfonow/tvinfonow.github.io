After graduating from college, he worked as a doctor in California, a predicament that he likened to “an arranged marriage.” He has published three novels, most notably his 2003 debut The Kite Runner, all of which are at least partially set in Afghanistan and feature an Afghan as the protagonist. Following the success of The Kite Runner he retired from medicine to write full-time.</p><p>In 1970, Hosseini and his family moved to Iran where his father worked for the Embassy of Afghanistan in Tehran. In 1973, Hosseini’s family returned to Kabul, and Hosseini’s youngest brother was born in July of that year. In 1976, when Hosseini was 11 years old, his father secured a job in Paris, France, and moved the family there. They were unable to return to Afghanistan because of the April 1978 Saur Revolution in which the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power. In 1980, shortly after the start of the Soviet–Afghan War, they sought political asylum in the United States and made their residence in San Jose, California. Hosseini, then aged 15, did not speak English when he first arrived in the United States. He describes the experience as “a culture shock” and “very alienating”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Khaled Hussain</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kimmo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Thomas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 4</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kabul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kabul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Afghanistan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Khaled Hussain ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Hosseini did not return to Afghanistan until 2001 at the age of 36, where he “felt like a tourist in [his] own country”.
