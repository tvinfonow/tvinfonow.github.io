The first Lost Boys show consisted of Graves on an acoustic guitar and vocals while Dr. CHUD played drums. They played Misfits songs they had written while in the band as well as songs which later came to be songs used for the band Graves which Graves wrote. The second show was the same music played as the first show, only this time the lineup consisted of Graves on vocals and electric guitar (he used Doyle’s old Ibanez Iceman which has been used to record such Misfits albums as “Walk Among Us” and “Earth A.D./Wolfsblood” and was given to Graves as a gift upon joining the Misfits back in 1995), Dr. CHUD on drums and J~Sin Trioxin on bass. Later on as an encore set, JV Bastard took the stage and joined the band to play guitar as Graves sang.

Under the assumed name of Graves they recorded a five-song demo of redone Graves songs, three which were released on Web of Dharma and two other songs which had been written and demoed with the original Graves lineup, but not officially released. Around this time is also when Graves announced via his website that he would begin producing other bands albums on his off time. One such band is Stressbomb from Connecticut who recorded their first album “Self Medicate” with Graves as producer and his drummer Quincy as engineer during January 2006. After a few months of the band practicing, they decided to change the band’s name to Gotham Rd. They released one album before going on hiatus so Graves could join the U.S. Marines. His last show ever was to be on December 31, 2004. They went on two successful tours. 2003’s Seasons of the Witch tour, and 2004’s Mourning Lights tour. Before their Mourning Lights tour, the band entered a studio to record three new songs they had written after their first tour. Out of the three songs only one, the song on “My Way”, had been mixed. The only way it was available for listening was by requesting it on Seton Hall University’s WSOU, Pirate Radio. Before going on indefinite hiatus they’d play one off shows in New Jersey when home from the Punk Rock is Dead, Graves solo tour. Their second to last show to date was held at the now defunct Connections in Clifton, New Jersey, in March 2005. The band announced “The Nightmare Rides Are Back” all over the net and played a one-time-only reunion show in Belmar, New Jersey, at the Goodwill Fire Hall with Cryptovyrus, The Zombie Mafia, Morbid Visions and Johnny B. Morbid. They played a mix of material from Graves’ solo works, Graves re-records, and Gotham Road, as well as some Misfits songs written by Graves. In 2008 and 2009 the band contributed some songs to the German compilation-CDs Get acquainted Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.</p><p>Right before his leave for the Marines, Graves was approached by Horror High Records to do a solo album. He eventually recorded his debut solo record Punk Rock is Dead in 2005. The entire album was written and recorded with friend and bandmate in Gotham Road, Paul Lifeless on drums in only one month. After being honorably discharged due to a back injury, Graves went to embark on a tour in support of the album with Loki, JV Bastard and Matt Johnson.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michale Graves height</b> Not available right now.

Before the band finished writing songs, recording, touring and even solidifying a lineup, Graves rejoined the Misfits, but only as a guest vocalist for a month during the M25 kickoff tour. He would perform Misfits songs written during the time of his tenure with the band to raise money for his new project, Graves. During a two-day break on their Web of Dharma 2 Tour, the band recorded what was to be new material for a second album in Ripsnorter Studios, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The studio is owned by members of the Minneapolis Horror Rock band, Ripsnorter, who offered the band free studio time. The recordings were never finished due to disagreements between the mixing of the songs and have never officially been released. After two successful US tours and the verge of a breakout record contract, Graves dissolved due to differences between Graves and Chud, after only releasing one album.</p><p align=justify>Graves has written an album entitled Illusions with Echols. The album consists of 15 songs and has been released October 31, 2007. The lyrics are written by Echols and Graves, and feature J~Sin Trioxin and Quincy Smash. A year later, in October 2008, Graves released Illusions Live/Viretta Park, a combination live album and demo EP. It was recorded on 24 April 2008, at Club Bourbon in New Port Richie, Florida, and 8 and 9 July 2008, at Bucharest, Romania.</p><h2>Who is Michale Graves Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Michale Graves</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
