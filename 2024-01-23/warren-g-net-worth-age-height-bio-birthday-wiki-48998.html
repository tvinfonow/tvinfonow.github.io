West Coast rapper and hip producer who became famous through “Regulate,” his 1994 debut single.</p><p>The first group he was in was 213 that was formed in 1990 with the future stars&nbsp;His first band was 213, formed in 1990, with future notables <a href=#>Nate Dogg</a> and <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Snoop Dogg..</p><p>Warren Griffin III (born November 10, 1970), or Warren G, is an American rapper and record producer who, aiding the G-funk sound, assisted West Coast rap’s 1990s ascent. In 1990, he had formed with Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg a trio, 213. Topping his seven Top 40 hits, the 1994 single “Regulate,” Warren’s duet with Nate, was a massive hit. Earlier, despite his teenage jailings in his California hometown Long Beach, having pioneering gangsta rapper Dr. Dre for older stepbrother, and having standout lyricist Snoop for groupmate, Warren G took a unique path into the rap subgenre G-funk’s success.</p><p>In 1982, Warren went to live with his father in North Long Beach. His new wife, Verna, had from a prior marriage three children. Among them was Andre Young, soon the Dr. Dre who in 1984 joined a leading DJ crew, the World Class Wreckin’ Cru, which by 1985 doubled as an electro rap group, which in 1987 put out the Los Angeles area’s first rap recording under a major label. By then, a Jordan High School student, Warren was playing football and running with friends.</p><p align=justify>He married Tennille Griffin.&nbsp;His parents owned a large collection of funk, jazz, and soul music and allowed him to listen to it during his early years.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Warren G</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Warren</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>G</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Long Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tennille Griffin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Olaijah Griffin</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Warren G ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, Warren G's ethnicity is <strong>Black</strong>. We will update Warren G's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>By 1990, in his hometown Long Beach, as record producer and rapper, Warren formed a music trio with two of his longtime running mates, Nathaniel “Nate Dogg” Hale, a rapperlike singer, and Calvin “Snoop Rock” Broadus, a singerlike rapper. The Long Beach trio, fond of Oakland rap group 415, named after the Bay area’s area code, took the name 213, the Los Angeles area’s. Practicing and recording in the modest studio in Long Beach record store V.I.P., they cut a demo tape. Dr. Dre, already a celebrity, rebuffed his younger stepbrother Warren’s requests for him to listen.</p><h2>Warren G Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Warren G is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Warren G</b>'s net worth <strong>$10 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He worked with Mista Grimm on the score for the 1993 film Poetic Justice, which gained him some attention early on.</p><p align=justify>He was honoured by Mayor Long Beach with Warren G Week which ran from the beginning to on the 6th of August 2005.</p><p align=justify>Warren Griffin III was born on November 10, 1970, in Long Beach, a city in California’s Los Angeles county. Among three sisters, he was the only son of Warren Griffin, Jr., an airplane mechanic, and Ola, a dietician. Once they divorced at his age 4, he lived with his mother and three sisters in East Long Beach until he was just about to start middle school.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By 1990, Warren had formed with two longtime running mates, Nathaniel “Nate Dogg” Hale and Calvin “Snoop Dogg” Broadus, the trio 213, the origin of a share of the G-funk sound to soon emerge in rap. Yet the trio, in practice, dissolved once Warren connected the trio to Dre, who thereby launched two superstar, solo careers, Dre’s and Snoop’s, upon G-funk. Nate, too, signed to Dre’s Death Row Records, in Los Angeles city. Warren initially helped there, but, averting a career in his mentor’s shadow, signed to Def Jam Recordings, in New York City.</p><p>In April 1992, Dr. Dre’s debut solo single “Deep Cover” introduced America to Snoop Doggy Dogg, the track’s guest but instantly star rapper. Warren helped Dre find sounds for Dre’s debut solo album The Chronic, further debuting Snoop, whereby superstardom chased Snoop into 1993 and, via Snoop’s own debut solo album, Doggystyle, captured him by 1994. By then, also solo, Nate, too, had joined Dre’s label, Death Row Records. Warren, returning to Long Beach, aimed to find his own way. In 2004, a 213 album finally arrived: The Hard Way. Yet since 1993, indeed finding his own way, Warren G, in records like “Regulate,” would be heard incidentally, and mysteriously to many, hailing three digits, 2-1-3.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Warren G height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Warren <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At age 17, Warren was jailed for gun possession. Released soon, he began focusing on music after Dre taught him how to use a drum machine. Meanwhile, still in 1988, Dre was the lead record producer for Ruthless Records and for, as a member of, N.W.A—a new rap group on the new label—whose landmark album, Straight Outta Compton, was driving the Los Angeles area’s rap scene to swiftly drop electro for gangsta, while Warren, fresh out of high school, was jailed for selling drugs. Once out, he worked at the Long Beach shipyards.</p><p align=justify>Yet further, unlike other G-funk, short for gangsta funk, Warren G, even called “a romantic” at heart, voiced simpler concerns. And his modest rap styling maximized, by heeding, his modest lyricism. “Regulate” doubled as the lead single Warren G’s debut album, Regulate… G Funk Era, arriving in June 1994. Selling a million copies in three days, it debuted at #2 on the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200. In August, it was certified 2x Multi-Platinum, two million copies sold. Its second single, “This D.J.,” went gold, half a million copies, in September, while peaking in July at #9. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, in March, both singles were nominated. And in January, the album’s other single, “Do You See,” had peaked at #42. In August, the album was certified 3x Multi-Platinum. That month also brought some Warren G collaborations on two albums from his Long Beach associates, the Twinz duo’s Conversation and The Dove Shack trio’s This Is the Shack. And 1996 saw Warren G on the “Groupie” track of Snoop’s second album, Tha Doggfather.</p><h2>Who is Warren G Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Warren G</strong> married to <strong>Tennille Griffin</strong>.

Singleton asked Warren to produce a song for the soundtrack of his forthcoming film Poetic Justice. Warren thus produced Mista Grimm’s song “Indo Smoke,” featuring Warren G and Nate Dogg. The single’s success led to Warren invitation to Russell Simmons’s label Def Jam Recordings, where Warren G signed a record deal. Also that year, Warren and Nate, along with Kurupt—whom the 213 trio had brought to Dre to help on his album The Chronic—feature on “Ain’t No Fun,” a huge underground hit, too risque to be a single, on Snoop’s Doggystyle album, released in November.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Warren Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Rapper</strong>.
