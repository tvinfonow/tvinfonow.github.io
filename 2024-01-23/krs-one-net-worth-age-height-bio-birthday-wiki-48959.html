Who is KRS-One dating now & how much money does KRS-One have?</p><h2>KRS-One Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>KRS-One</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rapper</strong> who was born on <strong>August 20, 1965</strong> in The Bronx, New York State, <strong>United States</strong>. American rapper who received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2008 BET Awards for his work in the Stop the Violence Movement. He developed the collective Boogie Down Productions, with whom he released his album Criminal Minded in 1987.</p><p>He was featured on <a href=#>Michael Stipe</a>‘s band, R.E.M.’s song, Radio Song in 1991.</p><p>Lawrence “Kris” Parker (born August 20, 1965), better known by his stage names KRS-One, and Teacha, is an American rapper and occasional producer from The Bronx, New York. He rose to prominence as part of the hip hop music group Boogie Down Productions, which he formed with DJ Scott La Rock in the mid-1980s. KRS-One is best known for his top hits, “Sound of da Police”, “Love’s Gonna Get’cha (Material Love)”, and “My Philosophy”, among others. Boogie Down Productions received numerous awards and critical acclaim in their early years. Unfortunately, following the release of the group’s debut album, Criminal Minded, fellow artist Scott La Rock was shot and killed, but KRS-One continued the group, effectively as a solo project. He began releasing records under his own name in 1993. He is politically active, having started the Stop the Violence Movement after Scott’s death. He’s also a vegan activist, expressed in songs such as “Beef”. He is widely considered as an influence to many well known hip hop artists, such as 2Pac and Eminem just to name few.</p><p>Following the fatal shooting of Scott La Rock in 1987, KRS was determined to continue Boogie Down Productions through the tragedy, releasing the album By All Means Necessary in 1988. He was joined by beatboxer D-Nice, rapper Ramona “Ms. Melodie” Parker (whose marriage to Kris would last from 1988 to 1992), and Kris’s younger brother DJ Kenny Parker, among others. However, Boogie Down Productions would remain KRS’ show, and the group’s content would become increasingly political through the subsequent releases Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop, Edutainment, Live Hardcore Worldwide and Sex and Violence.</p><p align=justify>He was married to fellow musician Ms. Melodie for five years before divorcing. He later married Simone Parker. His stepson, Randy, committed suicide in 2007.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>KRS-One</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>KRS-One</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>The Bronx</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ms. Melodie , Simone Parker</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Randy Hubbard Parker</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>KRS-One ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
