The band recorded their first album, Ataxia’s Alright Tonight when the band members were still in high school, and began touring aggressively throughout the DIY punk underground in North America and Europe. As a front-person, Mosshart distinguished herself through her intense, erratic, and earnest stage presence. Discount’s subsequent album, Half Fiction, was subsequently named the 50th Greatest Pop-Punk Album of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. The band moved from Vero Beach to Gainesville, and released their final album, Crash Diagnostic in 2000. The album reflected a move toward more angular sounds and detached lyrics than the emotionally frank pop-punk of the previous two albums. After touring in support of the album, the band played their last show in Gainesville in August, 2000.</p><p>Before the two even met, Mosshart, while on tour with Discount, overheard Hince playing music in a squat above where she and the band were staying. She finally approached him, after which they started playing around with some music ideas. After she went back to Florida, she continued writing songs with Hince, by sending her ideas overseas to London where he lived. She became very exhausted and ill, so after saving money, Mosshart moved to London and the duo officially started. She has tattooed the date of their first concert on her left hand: 14 February 2002.</p><p align=justify>She was raised in Vero Beach Florida.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alison Mosshart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alison</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mosshart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 23</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1978</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Vero Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Vivian Mosshart, Mark Mosshart</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Alison Mosshart ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
