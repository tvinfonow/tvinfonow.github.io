Abroad in England for school, the 16-year-old Gold scored his first recording contract on the strength of a selection of demos he submitted to Polydor Records’ London office. That contract resulted in the single “Of All the Little Girls,” which was recorded with his friend and collaborator Charlie Villiers, and released in 1967 under the name Villiers and Gold.</p><p>By the early 1970s, Gold was working full-time as a musician, songwriter and record producer. He was a member of the Los Angeles band Bryndle, alongside Kenny Edwards, Wendy Waldman, and Karla Bonoff, releasing the single “Woke Up This Morning” in 1970. He played a major role as multi-instrumentalist and arranger for Linda Ronstadt’s breakthrough album, 1974’s Heart Like a Wheel, and her next two albums. After Ronstadt’s Hasten Down the Wind Gold began a career as a solo artist. Among other accomplishments, he played the majority of instruments on “You’re No Good,” Ronstadt’s only No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100, and the same on “When Will I Be Loved,” “Heat Wave” and many other classic hits. He was in her band from 1973 until 1977, and then sporadically throughout the 1980s and 1990s, appearing at some of her concert appearances.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Andrew Gold</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rommel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Asenjo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Multi-Instrumentalist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Burbank</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Leslie Ann Kogan</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Victoria Gold, Olivia Gold, Emily Gold</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Andrew Gold ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The year 1975 also marked a successful collaboration with Art Garfunkel, wherein Gold played most of the instruments on Garfunkel’s solo hit “I Only Have Eyes For You” (which went to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart), as well as several other cuts on Garfunkel’s album Breakaway.</p><p align=justify>In 1981, Gold produced, co-wrote, sang and played on three 10cc tracks that appeared on the hit-making pop-rock band’s 1981 album Ten Out of 10.

Although he had worked with them in the studio, business conflicts prevented him from joining their ranks. In late 1983, 10cc broke up, and in the aftermath, Gold and Gouldman formed Wax. Wax recorded and toured for five years. They enjoyed international success, particularly in the UK, where the duo had several hits including “Right Between the Eyes” and their biggest hit, “Bridge to Your Heart”. Wax broke up as a recording and touring entity in 1989, but Gold and Gouldman continued to write and record together whenever possible.</p><h2>Who is Andrew Gold Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Andrew Gold</strong> married to <strong>Leslie Ann Kogan </strong>.
