His most well-known role is hosting The Richard Bey Show, a daytime talk show that he hosted in the 1990s.</p><p>He often poked fun at&nbsp;On his talk show he frequently poked fun at <a href=#>Jerry Springer</a>.&nbsp;on his talk show.</p><p>Richard would frequently make fun of Jerry Springer on his show, as when he lost his contact lenses and was forced to wear eyeglasses, remarking, “Don’t worry, you’re not watching Jerry Springer” and showing Jerry in his “Bad Neighbors” segment, a reference to Springer’s show being the lead-in or lead-out to Bey on many stations in the early-to-mid 1990s. He would also make light of Ricki Lake, Rosie O’Donnell, Phil Donahue, and Oprah Winfrey’s shows. Bey also hosted a prime time show called “Night Games”. It was short-lived but ran around the time his daytime show was at its peak. It ran after 10 o’clock and was a little more ribald with sexually clad women engaged in contests.</p><p>The Richard Bey Show (1992–1996) was produced from WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey and later syndicated across the country by All American Television (known today as FreemantleMedia). It featured such competitive events as the “Miss Big Butt” contest, the “Mr. Puniverse” contest, “Country Drag Queens versus City Drag Queens”, “Dysfunctional Family Feud” and “Blacks who think O.J. is guilty vs. Whites who think he is innocent.” Young women who were guests on the show were sometimes placed in a spoof of The Dating Game in which the guest interviewed three hidden “bachelors”, all of whom were an obvious mismatch for the “bachelorette” (e.g., a drag queen or a dwarf). Bey’s show made frequent use of sound effects like “uh-duh” for an insane response, “I’ve been framed” for a guest proclaiming innocence and “You’re busted!” for one accused of wrongdoing. Bey would often exclaim “Where do they find these people?!” in the presence of unbelievable guests or audience members. During some shows, there would be a secret word, and if an audience member used it in a comment, he would receive $100 (an homage to a prior talk and game show, You Bet Your Life). A joking suggestion was then made on how to spend it: “Lobster dinner tonight!”</p><p align=justify>He was the son a Jewish father, and an Irish Catholic mother.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richard Bey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Richard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tv Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Queens</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Richard Bey ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
