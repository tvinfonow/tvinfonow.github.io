Robert Dekeyser, a Belgian-German entrepreneur was born 7 October 1964. He is also a former goalkeeper for football.&nbsp;DEDON [de] is a German-based outdoor furniture manufacturer with distribution in over 80 countries.&nbsp;Dekeyser, an outdoor enthusiast, is also the founder and CEO of DEDON ISLAND in the Philippines.</p><p>Dekeyser then met a Cebu furniture manufacturer during a 1991 visit to the Cologne Furniture Fair. Cebu is a Philippine island well-known for its skilled weavers.&nbsp;Dekeyser agreed to allow him to produce woven rattan furniture with DEDON Fiber.&nbsp;Dekeyser soon moved his family to Cebu, where he spent six years developing DEDON’s first weaving products.&nbsp;Ann-Kathrin Dekeyser, his wife, and he purchased an old farm near Hamburg Harbor on Luneburg Heath where DEDON furniture could be shipped from the Philippines.</p><p>In 2004 Dekeyser moved the company headquarters to the outskirts of Lüneburg. The headquarters, which included a facility for the production of DEDON Fiber, received media attention in Germany for their relaxed, family-like atmosphere and the many perks employees enjoyed, including billiards, yoga, sauna, gym and a chef. Berlin’s Der Tagesspiegel daily newspaper dubbed Dekeyser’s emphasis on employee satisfaction, both in Germany and the Philippines, “The Bobby Principle”.</p><p>In 2006 Dekeyser sold a 49 percent stake in DEDON to a US-based private equity firm but soon regretted the sale. The “friendly atmosphere” of the company was being replaced by a focus on “money and numbers,” he later explained. With the financial help of investor Daniel Borer, a Swiss physician, who assumed a minority interest in DEDON in 2009, Dekeyser was able to pay back the bank loans the private equity company had left behind.</p><p align=justify>After spending a season with Belgium’s KRC Genk in the first division, Dekeyser was transferred to TSV 1860 Munich, where he was the starting goalkeeper.&nbsp;He was injured in an elbow blow to his face during his 16th appearance for the team and spent several weeks in hospital.&nbsp;He learned through the newspaper that he was being replaced as goalkeeper while he was in hospital.&nbsp;Despite his fury at his dismissal, Dekeyser was persuaded by the newspapers to make a three game comeback for 1860 Munich after the injury of the replacement goalkeeper.&nbsp;These were his “best three games” in professional football.&nbsp;He was offered numerous offers by second and first division teams, but he decided to retire from professional football after the 1990-1991 season.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=4><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert Dekeyser</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Robert</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dekeyser</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 7</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1964</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leuven</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Flemish Region</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belgium</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Ann-Kathrin Dekeyser (m. ?–2010)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Carolin Dekeyser, Estikay, Marie Dekeyser</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Robert Dekeyser ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It is furnished with the same attention to quality, comfort and aesthetics as indoor living rooms.&nbsp;After his retirement from professional soccer, Dekeyser worked closely with his uncle, an engineer who is an expert in plastics extrusion to create a weather-resistant synthetic fiber with a natural appearance and feel.&nbsp;He was unsure how to make his “outdoor living space” idea a reality.</p><p align=justify>Dekeyser, 16 years old, joined the Junior A-League Team 1.&nbsp;FC Kaiserslautern, where he remained until 1982, was his goalkeeper.&nbsp;In 1984, Dekeyser joined Royal Union Saint-Gilloise, Belgium’s second division, upon his release.&nbsp;Jean-Marie Pfaff (FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper) recommended that Dekeyser be brought in to replace the reserve keeper who had been sidelined by a long-term injury.&nbsp;He was then transferred to 1.

A converted chicken coop served as Dekeyser’s office. Furniture deliveries were stored in the barn. In 2000 DEDON opened its own production facility on Cebu so as to better control the design and quality of its furniture. This, along with the adoption of powder-coated aluminum frames, the introduction of more contemporary designs, and the development of innovative marketing campaigns, helped DEDON to grow rapidly. Over the next five years, sales increased by more than 1,300 percent.
