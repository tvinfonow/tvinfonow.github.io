Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>At the start of his sophomore year (2002), Anderson was thrust into the starting role as a quarterback and handed the reins of a rapidly improving program. Despite an early string of losses, Oregon State had no serious competition for quarterback in 2002 and his job was secure.</p><h2>Derek Anderson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Derek Anderson is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Derek Anderson</b>'s net worth <strong>$24 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He had a successful college career at Oregon State University.</p><p align=justify>He was drafted in 2005 by the Baltimore Ravens, but waived before the season began; he then signed with Cleveland, but didn’t play until the 2006 season.</p><p align=justify>Derek Matthew Anderson (born June 15, 1983) is a former American football quarterback who played 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the sixth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Oregon State. A 2007 Pro Bowler, Anderson has also played for the Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals Carolina Panthers, and the Buffalo Bills.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$24 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Anderson is the fourth player in Pac-10 history to throw for over 4,000 yards in a single season, setting an Oregon State Beavers football record at 4,058 yards in the 2003 season. He ranks second in the Pac-10 for career touchdown passes, at 79 (also an Oregon State record). He is the 6th person to ever throw for 10,000 yards in a career in the Pac-10.</p><p>Throughout the 2004 season, Anderson successfully branched out and surprised many defenses with his ability to escape the tackle and run the ball effectively. Although the team’s 7–5 performance was far from spectacular, Anderson became nationally recognized as a dangerous offensive weapon who could strike long gains at will. The Beavers went without Steven Jackson through the 2004 season (Jackson was drafted into the NFL at the end of the 2003 season). Even without the star running back, Anderson led his team back into the Insight Bowl where they again faced Notre Dame (led by future Browns teammate Brady Quinn). The Beavers never trailed in the game and defeated the Irish 38–21. Anderson passed for 359 yards and had four touchdown passes with no interceptions.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Derek Anderson height</b> <strong>6 feet 5 inches</strong> Derek <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 5 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As a freshman in the 2001 season, Anderson appeared in five games and recorded 263 passing yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions.</p><p align=justify>Anderson served as Frye’s backup for the Cleveland Browns in 2006 season. He made his NFL debut against the Denver Broncos at Cleveland Browns Stadium, on October 22, taking one snap after Frye was briefly shaken up. His second NFL appearance was more noteworthy. After Frye injured his wrist during the first half of Cleveland’s December 3 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Anderson played the entire second half. He threw his first two NFL touchdowns in that game, connecting with tight end Steve Heiden twice in the fourth quarter. Anderson scrambled for 33 yards in overtime, moving the ball from the Kansas City 45-yard line to the 12-yard line, after which the Browns were in field goal range. His play was instrumental in leading the Browns back from a 28–14 deficit to a 31–28 overtime victory. Overall, Anderson appeared in five games and recorded 793 passing yards, five touchdowns, and eight interceptions in the 2006 season.</p><h2>Who is Derek Anderson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Derek Anderson</strong> married to <strong>Mallory Anderson </strong>.

The pass was ruled out of bounds and held up through review. Anderson argued that Winslow was forced out, but the force-out rule was not reviewable. The game was notable for the officials’ missed call of a Braylon Edwards catch and tackle by contact, but mistakenly ruled a touchdown as Edwards got up and ran to the endzone.</p><h3>How much does Derek Anderson make?</h3><table><tr>Contract:1 yr(s) / $1,120,000</tr><tr><td>Signing Bonus</td><td>$90,000</td></tr><tr><td><b>Average Salary</b></td><td><b>$1,120,000</b></td></tr><tr><td>Total Guarantees</td><td>$90,000</td></tr><tr><td>Guaranteed at Signing</td><td>$90,000</td></tr></table><h3>How long did Derek Anderson play in the NBA?</h3><table readability=3><tr>Personal information</tr><tr readability=2><td>College</td><td>Ohio State (1992–1994) Kentucky (1995–1997)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>NBA draft</td><td>1997 / Round: 1 / Pick: 13th overall</td></tr><tr readability=2><td colspan=2>Selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers</td></tr><tr><td>Playing career</td><td><b>1997–2008</b></td></tr></table><h3>Where did Derek Anderson go to high school?</h3><p>Derek Anderson’s excitement just bubbles over with each new honor coming his way.
