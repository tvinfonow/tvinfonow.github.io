The book, published in November 2009, examines the entrepreneurial economy of Israel and the cultural and social environment that supports this economy. “It’s a book about Israel that’s not for Jews,” Senor has said. “I didn’t want it to be in the Judaica section of the bookstore, or the Israel or the Middle East section.” Instead, the book is typically found in the Business section of the bookstore. The book has provoked a wide range of responses, from reviews that hail its research and its portrayal of often-neglected facets of Israeli society, to reviews that claim the book implicitly justifies never-ending conflict in the region. Senor and Singer have been praised for the effectiveness with which they have “translat[ed] Israel’s own image of itself for an international audience”; their book’s title has entered the language as shorthand descriptive term for Israel. The book inspired the creation of Start-Up Nation Central, a non-profit organization based in Tel-Aviv.</p><h3>What is Dan Senor doing now?</h3><p>He currently serves on the advisory board for nonprofit America Abroad Media.
