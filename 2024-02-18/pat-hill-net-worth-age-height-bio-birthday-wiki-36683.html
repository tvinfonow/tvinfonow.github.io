A 1973 graduate of, and an offensive lineman for the University of California, Riverside, Hill was the offensive line coach at Los Angeles Valley College from 1974 to 1976. In 1977, he became the offensive line coach at the University of Utah, where he would stay through 1980. This was followed by short stints at UNLV in 1981 and 1982, and a one-year stay in the Canadian Football League with the Calgary Stampeders in 1983. After an assistant coaching job at Fresno State, Hill went on to become the offensive coordinator at the University of Arizona from 1990 to 1991. He then went to coach in the National Football League with the Cleveland Browns (under Bill Belichick) and the Baltimore Ravens, where he served as the tight ends and offensive line coach for both teams.</p><p>Hill took on the head coaching job at Fresno State in 1997, where he had previously served as the offensive line coach from 1984 to 1989. Coming into the 2005 season, Hill had compiled a 64-38 win-loss record, including a 44-19 Western Athletic Conference mark, one WAC title, and a 10-8 record against BCS AQ conference teams, the most by any BCS non-AQ conference team. Under Hill Fresno State routinely scheduled—and defeated—highly ranked opponents from power conferences. Taking his cue from how Bobby Bowden turned Florida State into a powerhouse, Hill let it be known soon after arriving in Fresno that his Bulldogs would play “anybody, anywhere, anytime.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pat Hill</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marcus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gilchrist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Coach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Pat Hill ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
