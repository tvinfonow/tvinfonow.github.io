He performed under the stage name Raekwon The Chef as well as the aliases Shallah Raekwon, Shallah Diamond and Lex Diamonds. Wu-Tang Clan debuted one year later with Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Singles from the album included “Protect Ya Neck” and “C.R.E.A.M.”, the latter of which reached #8 on the Billboard rap chart. Wu-Tang Forever followed in 1997 and was certified four times platinum by the RIAA, quadruple the certification given Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).
