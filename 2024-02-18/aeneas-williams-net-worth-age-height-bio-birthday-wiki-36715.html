Eventually, after being encouraged by his old high school teammate Maurice Hurst, he decided to join the team as a walk-on. He started out playing mostly on special teams, by made the starting lineup in the 5th game. In the following season, Williams was named to the All-Southwestern Athletic Conference team after leading the conference with seven interceptions.

Despite playing mostly for bad teams (1998 was the only time he played on a winning team during his 10 years in Arizona), Williams was recognized as one of the best cornerbacks in the league, making six Pro Bowls in all as a Cardinal. He is regarded as one of the best defenders and players in Cardinals history, as well as one of the greatest shutdown corners of all time.
