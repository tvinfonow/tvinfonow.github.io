In January 2003, Peter Holmes, writing for The Sun-Herald, said that Evans was devastated by the reversal. Paul Cashmere of Undercover noted that eight of the twenty-eight songs in AC/DC’s 2000-2001 Stiff Upper Lip Tour set-list were originally recorded with Evans, Cashmere could not understand why the nomination was withdrawn “despite Mark’s front-line position in the band’s most important period”. According to Allmusic’s Eduardo Rivadavia, Evans was “cruelly denied induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in 2003, along with his former band mates”. This situation may be linked to the long legal battle that Mark Evans waged against AC/DC, and which was finally settled out of court.</p><h2>Mark Evans Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Mark Evans is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from Australia.
