Kamron Doyle (born on 13 January 1998) is an American bowler with ten pins who hails from Brentwood, Tennessee.</p><p>On the 26th of August in 2012, Kamron had a stellar performance at a PBA South Region tournament in Canton, GA, finishing in third place among 75 bowlers.&nbsp;In the 21 qualifying games he played, Kamron posted a total of bowling score of 46466 (a 221.24 per cent average) and posted a loss record in match play.&nbsp;In the 16th round, Kamron defeated 2012 PBA Tour titleholder Scott Newell, 3 games to 1. The first match, in which Kamron won by 299-289 was by far the most thrilling match during the competition.&nbsp;Kamron also scored scores of 229 244, 261 and 261 to finish off a great four-game block.&nbsp;Kamron then defeated Mike Williams II, 2 games to 1 , in Round 8 and then faced the eventual winner of the tournament and legendary bowler Walter Ray Williams, Jr. in round four.&nbsp;Kamron was defeated by Walter Ray, 226-214 in the semi-final game and took home $850 for the tournament.</p><p>In league play on December 8, 2012, Kamron blasted the pins for an 818 series with games of 239, 300 and 279, achieving his 15th perfect game and the fourth time he rolled an 800 series. On December 11, 2012, bowling with his high school, Kamron rolled a 247, 279, and a 278 for an 804 series—his fifth in his young “career.” On February 2, 2013, Kamron blasted the pins for his 16th perfect game, and he also rolled a 299.</p><p>At age 15, Doyle was again successful in his second trip to the U.S. Open in 2013, as he qualified 38th with a 24-game pinfall of 4,896 to make the 65-player cut line. Doyle shot 1,233 in the 6-game cashers round, failing to make the 24-player match play round and finishing 37th overall out of 260 bowlers to earn $1140. Doyle averaged 204.30 for the event and finished way ahead of such bowling legends as Chris Barnes (55th place), and Parker Bohn III and Walter Ray Williams Jr. (tied for 75th place).</p><p align=justify>The 23rd of February, 2012 at the age of 14 years old, Doyle became the youngest to ever win an PBA Tour major tournament, after he was ranked as 54th (out out of 394 bowlers representing 12 countries) and was 61st at the famous U.S. Open in North Brunswick, NJ.&nbsp;A scheduling blunder, Doyle, the youngest player at the event had in his qualification round at the exact lane as the 64-year-old PBA legendary Johnny Petraglia.&nbsp;Said Petraglia on behalf of Doyle who beat him by only 7 pins: “I think he is going to be terrific. I remember bowling with Pete Weber in a pro-am in St. Louis when he was maybe 15, and I see the same kind of swing, the same fiery attitude, the same attributes Pete had when he was a teenager.”&nbsp;At the U.S. Open, Doyle averaged 200.77 for the tournament and earned $1340 during the week. He was just ahead in the standings of PBA top players Tommy Jones (65th), Amleto Monacelli (66th), Tom Baker (67th), Walter Ray Williams Jr. (74th) George Branham III (77th), Petraglia (78th) along with Parker Bohn III (119th).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kamron Doyle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kamron</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doyle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>American Bowler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1998</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kamron Doyle ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
