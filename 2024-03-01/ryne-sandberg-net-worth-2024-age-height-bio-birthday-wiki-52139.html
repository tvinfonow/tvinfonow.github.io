It is one of the most infamous trades in MLB history.</p><p>Sandberg is one of two Hall of Famers who came up through the Phillies farm system and earned their Hall of Fame credentials primarily as Cubs, the other being Ferguson Jenkins. Similarly, Jenkins, then age 23, was traded to the Cubs in another trade that worked out better in the Cubs’ favor, a multi-player trade for 1960s workhorse pitcher Larry Jackson, then age 35, and Bob Buhl, then age 37, whose best days were behind him.</p><p>Sandberg was recruited to play quarterback at NCAA Division I colleges, and eventually signed a letter of intent with Washington State University in Pullman. He opted not to attend after being selected in the 20th round of the 1978 baseball amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies.</p><p align=justify>Margaret, his wife, founded a children’s charity.&nbsp;He is the father of Justin, a son, and Lindsey, a daughter.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ryne Sandberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ryne</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sandberg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Spokane</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Margaret Koehnemann , Cindy White</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Justin Sandberg, Lindsey Sandberg</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ryne Sandberg ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Playing in 13&nbsp;games, Sandberg had one hit in six at-bats for a .167 batting average during his brief stint with the team. The one hit occurred at Wrigley Field using a bat borrowed from starting shortstop Larry Bowa.</p><h2>Ryne Sandberg Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Ryne Sandberg is one of the <strong>richest Baseball Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ryne Sandberg</b>'s net worth <strong>$13 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He had originally planned to play quarterback at Washington State University but he renounced his commitment after he was drafted by the MLB.</p><p align=justify>He was an All-Star in ten games, won the Golden Glove nine consecutive times, and retired with a fielding percentage of.989</p><p align=justify>Ryne Dee Sandberg (born September 18, 1959), nicknamed “Ryno”, is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs for sixteen years (1981–94, 1996–97).</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$13 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Cubs, who initially wanted Sandberg to play center field, installed him as their third baseman, and he went on to be one of the top-rated rookies of 1982. After the Cubs acquired veteran Ron Cey following the 1982 season, they moved Sandberg to second base, where he became a star.</p><p>The Phillies did not have a role for him in the starting lineup, and did not project him as a successor at shortstop to Bowa. While Sandberg had played both second and third base in the minor leagues, he was blocked from those positions by Manny Trillo and Mike Schmidt. He was traded along with Bowa to the Cubs for shortstop Iván DeJesús prior to the 1982 season. The trade, now reckoned as one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history, came about after negotiations for a new contract between Bowa and the Phillies broke down.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ryne Sandberg height</b> <strong>6 ft 2 in</strong> Ryne <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 2 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sandberg was a three-sport star in high school at North Central and graduated in 1978. The previous fall he was named to Parade Magazine’s High School All-America football team, one of the eight quarterbacks, and one of two players from the state of Washington. The school’s baseball field was named in his honor in 1985 as “Ryne Sandberg Field”, and his varsity number was retired in both football and baseball.</p><p align=justify>After winning a Gold Glove Award in his first season at the new position, Sandberg emerged with a breakout season in 1984, in which he batted .314 with 200 hits, 114 runs, 36 doubles, 19 triples, 19 homers, and 84 RBIs. He nearly became only the third player to collect 20 doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases in the same season, led the Cubs to the National League’s Eastern Division title (their first championship of any kind since 1945), and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award, the first by a Cub since Ernie Banks’ back-to-back honors in 1958 and 1959.</p><h2>Who is Ryne Sandberg Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ryne Sandberg</strong> married to <strong>Margaret Koehnemann , Cindy White </strong>.

The Cubs had been playing well throughout the season’s first few months, but as a team unaccustomed to winning, they had not yet become a serious contender in the eyes of most baseball fans.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Ryne Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Baseball Player</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Ryne Sandberg celebrates birthday on September 18 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Cubs general manager Dallas Green wanted a young prospect to go along with the aging Bowa (as it turned out, Bowa’s playing career ended after the 1985 season). Green had been instrumental in the drafting of Sandberg in 1978, while working in the Phillies front office. The two remained close over the years. Years later, Phillies general manager Paul Owens said that he hadn’t wanted to trade Sandberg, but Green and the Cubs weren’t interested in any of the other prospects he offered, so he had gone back to his scouts, who said Sandberg wouldn’t be any more than a utility infielder. However, Sandberg had hit over .290 in the minors two years in a row. The trade is now considered one of the best (if not the best) in recent Cubs history. At the same time, it is considered one of the worst trades in Phillies, if not MLB history; DeJesus, despite helping anchor the Phillies infield on their way to the 1983 World Series, lasted only three years in Philadelphia, and was out of baseball by 1988.</p><h3>What happened to Ryan Sandberg?</h3><p>Sandberg, a notoriously slow early season starter, found himself struggling even more so than usual early in the 1994 season.
