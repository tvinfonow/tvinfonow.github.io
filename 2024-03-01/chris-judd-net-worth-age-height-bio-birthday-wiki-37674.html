Australian rules soccer midfielder who twice received the famous Brownlow Medal (2004 and 2010).</p><p>He and <a href=#>Shane Crawford</a> were both named to the All-League team several times. as well as&nbsp;He and <a href=#>Shane Crawford</a> were both named to the All-League team several times.&nbsp;were each named to the All-League team several times.</p><p>At his peak, Judd was the best midfielder in the game and is widely regarded as one of the best players of the 2000s decade. The strengths and traits of Judd’s playing style were different between his time at West Coast and his time at Carlton, and he has been widely lauded for his proficiency at both. At West Coast, while he was a strong ball-winner, it was as an outside midfielder and ball-user where he distinguished himself. He possessed a combination of explosive speed, acceleration, agility and core strength which few if any players in the league could match; these attributes gave him the ability to receive the ball in traffic, then break free from or weave around taggers and opponents, allowing him to take clearing kicks in open space which were damaging to opposition teams. By the time he had joined Carlton, he had lost much of his acceleration and agility owing to the groin injuries he suffered in 2007. He overcame this by converting his game style to predominantly inside ball-winning role. By virtue of his core strength and balance, he became one of the best in the league at receiving ruck tap-outs, and riding or shaking off tackles in packs and congestion to win clearing handpasses to Carlton’s outside midfielders.</p><p>Judd was a graduate of the 2000 AIS/AFL Academy and participated in the 2000 AFL Under 18 Championships, although due to his young age at 17, he was too young to be drafted by an AFL club. He played TAC Cup football with the Sandringham Dragons through to 2001.</p><p align=justify>He married model&nbsp;He married model <a href=#>Rebecca Twigley</a> in December 2010.
