Underwood, who lived near Bolin in the same apartment complex, was arrested on April 17, 2006. Underwood admitted to FBI agents and Oklahoma detectives that he had murdered and attempted to decapitate Bolin, telling them, “Go ahead and arrest me. She is in there. I chopped her up.” After Underwood’s confession, Bolin’s corpse, stashed in a large plastic container, was recovered from his bedroom closet.</p><p>On February 29, 2008, a jury found him guilty of first degree murder. A jury recommended the death penalty on March 7, 2008. On April 3, 2008, McClain County District Judge Candace Blalock approved the recommended death sentence. Underwood attempted to appeal his sentence on the grounds that it would be an unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment, due to his mental illness (he was initially diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder at his trial, but was later diagnosed with Asperger syndrome). The appeal was rejected by an Oklahoma City federal judge.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin Ray Underwood</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alec</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ounsworth</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Murderer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1979</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Connie Underwood, Larry Underwood</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kevin Ray Underwood ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
