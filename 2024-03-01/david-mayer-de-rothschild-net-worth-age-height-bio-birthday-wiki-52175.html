He had already become one of only 14 people ever to traverse the continent of Antarctica, and was part of a team that broke the world record for the fastest ever crossing of the Greenland ice cap. In 2006 he launched the website “Mission Control” in order to present his expeditions and environmental efforts to children and the youth. The trek across the Arctic was the first “mission” to be highlighted on the website, and the second was planned to either be a trek through the Amazon or a trek from Lake Baikal to the Gobi Desert.</p><h2>David Mayer de Rothschild Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>David Mayer de Rothschild is one of the <strong>richest Adventurer</strong> from United Kingdom.

His middle name “Mayer” is taken from the name of the founder of the Rothschild family banking empire, Mayer Amschel Rothschild. The youngest heir to his family’s banking fortune, de Rothschild was born in 1978 in London, England. His mother is American, the daughter of Marcia Lou (née Whitney) and real estate developer Lewis M. Schott. He is the younger brother of Anthony de Rothschild and Jessica de Rothschild. As a teenager, de Rothschild was a top-ranked horse jumper on Britain’s junior event team. He later gave up the sport to pursue his education, stating in an interview with The New Yorker “I realized there was more to life than spending hours and hours and hours on a horse.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Adventurer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>David de Rothschild was awarded the accolade of “Emerging Explorer” by National Geographic, was appointed an “international ambassador” by NGO Clean Up the World and nominated as a “Young Global Leader” by the World Economic Forum. In 2007 de Rothschild was named one of GQ Magazine’s men of the year, being the sole individual named to the “Environmentalist” category. The following year, due to his efforts at involving youth in environmental issues, he was the 2008 winner of the Kids’ Choice Awards UK “Greenie Award”. In 2009 Rothschild was named by the United Nations Environment Program as a “Climate Hero”. In 2011 de Rothschild served on the judging panel for the International Green Awards as well as the Climate Week Awards. In 2011 he also received the Honorary Award of the German Sustainability Award.</p><p>As part of Adventure Ecology’s ARTiculate series, de Rothschild led a field trip expedition to Ecuador in 2007. The group spent time in the Ecuadorian rain forest, documenting the damage international oil companies had caused by drilling the vast oil reserves. In November 2011 de Rothschild and a small crew mounted an expedition to Brazil’s Amazon rainforest as part of the ARTiculate series, with the goal of better understanding and publicizing the effects of the controversial Belo Monte dam project. This expedition was supplemented by articles on Myoo.com and culminated in an art project developed with local children. When asked by Outside Magazine reporter Caty Enders about whether an expedition could make a difference in a pressing issue like the Belo Monte dam de Rothschild replied that “it would be naïve to think that this mini art-based adventure into the Amazon is going to change what has been in motion for the last 36 years. But when you see someone in the road and they’re dying, do you keep walking and say, Oh, they’ll be dead soon? That’s the reality when you embark on an adventure like this, you may never know the true outcome until many years later”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>David Mayer de Rothschild height</b> <strong>1.93&nbsp;m</strong> Kristen <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1.93&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the late 2000s de Rothschild developed a mission to raise awareness of the Pacific Garbage Patch, in which he invented a new form of sustainable ship at a lab on Pier 31 in San Francisco, called the Plastiki. In March 2010, de&nbsp;Rothschild launched the boat, a 60-foot (18&nbsp;m) catamaran built from approximately 12,500 reclaimed plastic bottles and a unique recyclable technology called Seretex. Seretex, which was developed by de&nbsp;Rothschild and his team, was meant to reuse PET in a novel way, finding new uses for a waste product. The Plastiki and its crew sailed over 8,000 nautical miles (15,000&nbsp;km; 9,200&nbsp;mi) across the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to Sydney. The evening before their journey began, de Rothschild and his skipper Jo Royle interviewed with CNN, quoting Mark Twain when asked how he felt in anticipation for the trip.</p><p align=justify>The Plastiki successfully completed its journey to Sydney on 26 July 2010. Along with the Plastiki de&nbsp;Rothschild launched a platform for community interaction and sharing stories called “Myoo” (the name comes from the pronunciation of “community”). The Plastiki was named one of 2010’s fifty best inventions by Time magazine. The Plastiki is named after the Kon-Tiki, a raft used by Pacific explorer Thor Heyerdahl.</p><h2>Who is David Mayer de Rothschild Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>David Mayer de Rothschild</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

It’s made of cashew nuts and sugar….every part of the boat – from the interior with reclaimed materials, reclaimed fabric, is all trying to do our best and showcasing there are a lot of solutions out there.” In 2009, The New Yorker’s John Colapinto wrote about the Plastiki, comparing its creator, de Rothschild, to adventurers such as Sir Richard Francis Burton and Sebastian Snow.</p><h2>Top Facts about David Mayer de Rothschild</h2><li>David Mayer de Rothschild is a British adventurer and ecologist.</li><li>He was born in 1978 in London, England.</li><li>Rothschild founded the environmental organization Sculpt the Future Foundation.</li><li>In 2006, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean on a boat made of plastic bottles.</li><li>Rothschild has written several books on sustainability and conservation.</li><li>He has been featured in numerous documentaries about climate change and ecology.</li><li>Rothschild was named a National Geographic Emerging Explorer in 2010.</li><li>He has worked with organizations such as WWF and Greenpeace to promote environmental causes.</li><li>Rothschild advocates for sustainable living practices and reducing plastic waste.</li><li>He is also an accomplished public speaker on environmental issues.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Kristen Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Adventurer</strong>.
