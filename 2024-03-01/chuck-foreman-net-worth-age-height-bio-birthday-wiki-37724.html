He was limited on offense during his 1970 sophomore campaign due to injuries in the team’s defensive backfield, which necessitated that he change his position to cornerback. Fran Curci took over as head coach for the 1971 season and switched Foreman back to running back. That season, he combined with teammate Tom Sullivan to form a running back tandem nicknamed “The Gold Dust Twins” due to their running abilities. This was Foreman’s finest statistical season as a ball-carrier, as he rushed 191 times for 951 yards. He also caught 7 passes for 72 yards that season and was named a first-team All American by the publication Sporting News. Foreman transitioned to wide receiver for his senior season, and although his production on the ground dipped to 484 yards on 107 carries, his receiving production increased to 557 yards on 37 receptions. Foreman finished his college career having never played in a bowl game.</p><p>Foreman was born and raised in Frederick, Maryland where he attended Frederick High School, competing in basketball, football, and track and field. Growing up, he was a fan of the Washington Redskins and the Baltimore Colts of the NFL as well as the Baltimore Bullets of the NBA. Playing the end position on the football team, he began incorporating the spin move into his running style after watching Bullets player Earl Monroe use the same maneuver while playing basketball, a move which inspired Foreman’s nickname during his professional career. During his high school career, Foreman caught four touchdown passes in a single game against Bel Air High School. Although he received more scholarship offers for basketball than football, Foreman accepted a football scholarship from the University of Miami in 1970, as he enjoyed playing the sport more than basketball.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chuck Foreman</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Collen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Makgopela</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Running Back</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 26</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frederick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Maryland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jay Foreman</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Chuck Foreman ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He learned that he was drafted while sitting in his apartment at the University of Miami and at first felt consternation toward playing in Minnesota due to the cold, recalling a time in which flamethrowers were used to thaw the field of Metropolitan Stadium before a game. The Vikings were initially unsure how to utilize Foreman due to his experience playing multiple positions in college. He insisted on playing running back to prove wrong coach Curci, who had told him that he would never be able to play the position in the NFL.</p><p align=justify>Foreman was awarded first-team All-Pro honors and appeared in a third-consecutive Pro Bowl for his 1975 season.

In the final game of the regular season on the road against the Buffalo Bills, Foreman was in contention to complete an NFC Triple Crown by leading the conference in touchdowns, receptions, and rushing yards for a season. Foreman and Bills star running back O. J. Simpson were also competing to break Gale Sayers’s NFL record for combined rushing and receiving touchdowns in a season. After scoring his third touchdown of the game, Foreman was struck in the eye by a snowball thrown by a Bills fan and suffered from blurred vision as a result. Although he later scored a fourth touchdown in the game to tie the record at 22, head coach Bud Grant pulled Foreman from the game for the fourth quarter as a precaution. Simpson broke the record on a 64-yard touchdown reception to bring his total on the season to 23. Later that day, Jim Otis of the St. Louis Cardinals surpassed Foreman’s season rushing total by 6 yards.
