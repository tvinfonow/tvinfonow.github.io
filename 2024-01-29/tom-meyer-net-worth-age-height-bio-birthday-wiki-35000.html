He is best known as The Bible Memory Man because of his unique ability to quote over 20 complete books of the Bible dramatically from memory. Although he is often mischaracterized as having the entire Bible memorized. His book The Memorization Study Bible (2018) is published by Master Books and is the only Study Bible which specifically facilitates the memorization of the Bible, a popular spiritual exercise for many Evangelical Christians.</p><p>After graduating from Willowbrook High School in 1994, Meyer worked for his family’s business, Meyer Paving in Maple Park, IL. At age 26, Meyer left IL for college in CA, and shortly thereafter began to memorize and perform portions of the Bible as a one-man, Shakespearean routine to present the most famous book in the world in a whole new way. Circa 2003, he met Jason Nightingale, the now deceased founder of Wordsower Ministries International. Intrigued by the two-fold work of stateside dramatic Bible recitations as sermons and overseas mercy ministry to orphans and widows, Meyer joined Nightingale’s company and began quoting the entire book of Revelation from memory. Meyer, called a throwback because he recites the Bible from heart like ancient Israelites did thousands of years ago, has since recited the Bible from memory in over 30 states, in front of actor and now friend Chuck Norris and the President of Israel. Meyer expanded to full-time public speaking in 2010, at which point he also began to teach at his alma mater, Shasta Bible College. Meyer has appeared in numerous American TV, newspaper, and radio interviews such as Fox News, Moody Radio, CBN, and The Christian Post, as well as being featured in International newspapers and radio shows in Uganda, London, the Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Vietnam, Portugal, Germany, and Spain. He is an annual guest speaker at the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum and tours the USA each summer with his family to give his powerful presentations from coast to coast and inspire Christians to memorize Scripture. Most recently Meyer has gained distinction for speaking out against attempts to link Biblical prophecy to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, in 2020 Meyer began a series of exclusive interviews with the Daily Express of London. Meyer was interviewed on archaeological subjects like the possible location of the Ark of the Covenant, the Merenptah Stele, the Copper Scroll the crossing of the Red Sea and a possible correlation between the early chapters of Genesis and archaeology, although his position on the latter was criticized by the Daily Beast. Meyer was also interviewed by the Daily Express on eschatological subjects like the timing of the Rapture, a chronology of Biblical end times, the location of Armageddon, and the identity of the AntiChrist.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom Meyer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mieremet</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Writer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 9</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1976</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Elmhurst</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>4</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tom Meyer ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
