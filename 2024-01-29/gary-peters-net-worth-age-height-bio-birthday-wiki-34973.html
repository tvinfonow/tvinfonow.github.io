Gary David Peters (born 3 August 1954 in Carshalton, London) is a famous English professional football player who is manager.&nbsp;His last job was with Shrewsbury Town in from 2004 until 2008.</p><p>Peters returned to his former team Aldershot in the year 1984-85, in which he was a central defender.&nbsp;He stayed just one season, which he only made 23 appearances before leaving to return to Reading.&nbsp;His second season at Elm Park was a success, as the team move up into Division Two.&nbsp;Peters had more than 100 performances with The Royals in his second stint, and also managed the youth squad.&nbsp;He was back in Fulham and played in sporadic games during two seasons, before retiring in the year 1990.</p><p>In early 1998, with Preston sinking back towards Division Three, and having finished fifteenth two years running, Peters resigned and David Moyes was promoted to become their new manager. A month later, after considering his future, Peters rejoined Preston as the club’s Centre of Excellence Manager. He set about developing the club’s Centre of Excellence, nurturing the talents of local 9- to 16-year-olds. Recent graduates of the Preston academy include Paul McKenna and Andrew Lonergan. But with the Centre of Excellence ticking over, Preston chose to make Peters redundant, in a cost-cutting measure.</p><p>Exeter City quickly secured his services and issued him with the challenge, with just 13 matches of the 2002–03 season remaining, of preserving their league status. Peters lost this challenge, but Exeter lost only three of those 13 games. With the club in financial turmoil, the chairman and vice-chairman both resigned after they had been arrested as part of an investigation of club finances. Possibly facing a large points penalty for going into administration, having to release a large number of the playing staff and being unable to sign any new players, Peters resigned four days later. Peters joined Everton, where David Moyes was now manager, as a scout.</p><p align=justify>In the months of March through August Gary was among his Reading back five who kept the score clean for 1,103 minutes. This was an unbeaten record until Manchester Utd broke it.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gary Peters</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gary</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peters</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1954</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pontiac</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Colleen Ochoa (m. 1994)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Gary Peters ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Going into the 2005–06 season, Shrewsbury were favourites for relegation, and after a poor start to the season it looked a likelihood. But Peters turned Shrewsbury’s fortunes upwards, with the club even knocking Football League Championship club Brighton out of the League Cup and taking Sheffield United, also of the Championship, to a penalty shootout in the same competition. Towards the end of the season, a consistently good run of results gave Town a chance of reaching the play-offs, though the club eventually finishing tenth.</p><h2>Gary Peters Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Gary Peters is one of the <strong>richest Association Football Player</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Gary Peters</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Peters enjoyed a fairly successful career as a defender , which included stints in Aldershot (twice), Reading (twice), Fulham (twice) and Wimbledon.&nbsp;At first, he was rejected as a trainee at Aldershot and Reading, he started his career with Southern League Guildford City before going into Reading to play right back in the year 1975, being promoted to Division 3 during his debut season.&nbsp;When he failed to agree terms for a contract extension Peters was dismissed by Reading in 1979 after having played an appearance in 156 games.</p><p align=justify>The Football League tribunal decided upon the payment of a charge of PS25,000 for a transfer when Peters relocated to Fulham.&nbsp;After 64 games for Fulham, Peters then joined Wimbledon and had spent in the past four years bouncing between the fourth and third divisions after being elected to The Football League in 1977.&nbsp;In his debut season with The Dons (1982-83) Peters was instrumental in helping the club climb the ladder to Division Two as Fourth Division champions.&nbsp;The following season, Wimbledon was promoted again, with Peters who was now captain of the club gained promotion once more and made it to Division Two.&nbsp;However, Peters did not take part in the club’s activities at this level, as Peters was let go to join the fourth division of Aldershot.</p><p align=justify>Following his retirement as player, Peters took on roles as assistant manager at Fulham, Cambridge and Preston North End. After the departure of John Beck in late 1993–94, Peters was promoted to manager at Preston, who at the time were third from bottom of Division Three. Under Beck, Preston had played the long-ball system, but with Peters in charge the team played a more attractive passing game. He also changed their fortunes, as Preston won promotion to Division Two in 1996. During his time at Preston, Peters brought in players such as David Beckham (on loan) and Jon Macken. In 1997, he sold Kevin Kilbane for a club record fee of £1.2m. Jon Macken would eventually be sold by the club for another record, £5m, after scoring more than 70 goals for the club.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Association Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Despite being linked with the vacant managerial post at League One Tranmere Rovers, Peters agreed a two-year extension to his contract on 17 May 2006, which now ran until the end of the 2008–09 season. He finished the 2006–07 season by taking Shrewsbury to the play-off final at the new Wembley Stadium, after knocking out the highly fancied Milton Keynes Dons. However, Town lost 3–1 to Bristol Rovers in the final, ensuring another season in the fourth tier.</p><p>The 2007–08 season saw Peters managing the club at its new home, New Meadow. However, the new location failed to bring a positive effect on the field as the club faltered after a bright start. On 3 March 2008, after collecting just 6 points from 12 matches, Peters parted company with the club by mutual consent. His final game had been a 4–1 defeat at Barnet and was less than a season after a Wembley appearance.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Gary Peters height</b> Not available right now.
