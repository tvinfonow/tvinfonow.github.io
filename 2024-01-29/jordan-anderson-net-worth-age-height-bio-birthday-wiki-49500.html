After securing the last qualifying spot to race at Daytona in February, the team went on to log 8 Top 20 finishes throughout the season. Anderson’s truck garnered national attention in September as it was funded thanks in part to a “Fueled by Fans” campaign with over 120 fans sponsoring the truck to pay for a new motor for the team. Anderson would go on to finish in the Top 20 in the championship standings by only a mere point in the series for a second straight year.

After his No. 12 truck (which borrowed owner points from Rick Ware Racing) crashed at Atlanta, Anderson was left with no truck to drive for the season and made a website – SponsorJordan.com – for the fans to fund him a truck. While raising funds, Anderson started and parked RSS Racing’s second car. Due to the large time gaps between races, Anderson was back two races later at Kansas Speedway. He also ran one race in the NASCAR Xfinity Series for B. J. McLeod Motorsports, at Dover International Speedway. Starting at Kansas, Anderson teamed up with TJL Motorsports to use TJL’s owner points while bringing his own equipment to the track. He missed two races due to TJL having other drivers signed to drive, but otherwise ran the rest of the season and would go on to finish in the top 20 in the CWTS driver points for a third straight season. Besides his spring SponsorJordan.com initiative, Anderson received additional help throughout the season from former NASCAR driver Kenny Wallace after Gateway and ran another fan-funded campaign to close out the season.</p><p>On January 31, 2018, Anderson announced his intentions to run full-time in the 2018 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series season using the number 3 and running under his own Jordan Anderson Racing banner. Anderson chose the number 3 in connection with Junior Johnson. JAR acquired trucks from Niece Motorsports, who switched from Toyota to Chevrolet before 2018 and Brad Keselowski Racing, who ceased operations at the end of 2017. As for the first half of the 2018 season Anderson has an average finish of 19.7th and is 2 top 20 finishes away from tying his record of 8 top 20 finishes from the 2016 season.
