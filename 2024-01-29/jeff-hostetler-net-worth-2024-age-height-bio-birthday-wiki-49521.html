Former NFL quarterback who played for both the New York Giants and the Washington Redskins.</p><p>He was interviewed for the documentary One Moment in Time: The Life of <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a>.</p><p>Hostetler started his career at Penn State, where he started three games for the 1980 season. But Todd Blackledge soon beat him out for the starting quarterback job, and Hostetler transferred to West Virginia. Hostetler sat out the 1981 season, due to NCAA transfer rules.</p><p>Hostetler’s first game as a Mountaineer was a 41-27 win over the #9 1982 Oklahoma Sooners football team, when he threw for four touchdowns and 321 yards. The upset victory earned Hostetler Offensive Player of the Week honors from Sports Illustrated. Another big win that season was a week later against the Maryland Terrapins, who were led by Boomer Esiason. The Mountaineers won 19–18 against the Top 10 ranked Terps. The Terps lost the game on a two-point conversion, while Hostetler threw for 285 yards and a touchdown. Hostetler led the Mountaineers to the 1982 Gator Bowl, where they lost to Florida State 31–12. Hostetler totaled 1,916 yards with ten touchdown passes that season.</p><p align=justify>He married Vicky Hostetler and he has three children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff Hostetler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeff</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hostetler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jerome</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Doug Hostetler, Cher Stupar, Ron Hostetler, Lori Kehl, Todd Hostetler</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Vicky Hostetler</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Justin Hostetler, Tyler Hostetler, Jason Hostetler</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jeff Hostetler ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was also a fan favorite in Morgantown and inspired a record, “Ole Hoss (The Ballad of West Virginia’s Jeff Hostetler)”.</p><h2>Jeff Hostetler Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jeff Hostetler is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States.

In his first five seasons he played sparingly, rarely making an appearance as he was the third-string quarterback behind Phil Simms and Jeff Rutledge. His first start came late in the 1988 season, where he helped lead the Giants to victory in a road game against the New Orleans Saints. In 1989, he started a key game in the middle of the season, leading the Giants to a Monday night victory over the Minnesota Vikings. However, outside of these games, Hostetler’s primary roles were mop-up duty and as a holder for kickers Raul Allegre, Bjorn Nittmo, and Matt Bahr. In 2007, in the episode of America’s Game: The Super Bowl Champions that profiled the 1990 Giants team, Hostetler noted that he was frustrated with his lack of playing time and volunteered to play other positions, including wide receiver and blocker on the punt return team. On December 15, 1990, leading up to the Giants’ matchup with the Buffalo Bills, Hostetler became frustrated and recounted that he was all but done with football and was planning to retire at the end of the season.</p><p>During the summer of 1991, new coach Ray Handley made a decision regarding his quarterbacks. Instead of giving the starting job back to the now-healthy Simms, the coach held an open competition that Hostetler would ultimately win. He then led the Giants to victory in the season opener against the 49ers at home, snapping their NFL-record 18 game road winning streak. In his twelfth start against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Hostetler broke his back and missed the rest of the season. Of the games Hostetler started (including the one he didn’t finish), the Giants went 7-5. Simms, meanwhile, lost his first three starts against the lowly Cincinnati Bengals (who won only three times that year), the Philadelphia Eagles (a loss which eliminated the Giants from playoff contention), and the eventual Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins. The Giants managed to win their final matchup against the Houston Oilers to finish 8-8.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jeff Hostetler height</b> <strong>6 feet 3 inches</strong> Jeff <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 3 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1983, Hostetler led the #7 Mountaineers over Big East rival Pitt after a fourth quarter run to beat the Panthers 24–21, the first victory over Pitt in seven years. Hostetler led the game-winning drive that he capped out with a bootleg touchdown run for victory. In the 1983 Hall of Fame Bowl, Hostetler pulled out a come-from-behind 20-16 victory over the University of Kentucky, throwing two touchdowns. Hostetler finished his college career in the 1984 Hula Bowl and in the Japan Bowl. Hostetler threw for 2,345 yards and 16 touchdowns his senior season.</p><p align=justify>Following the 1993 regular season, Hostetler led the Raiders to an impressive 42-24 playoff win over the Denver Broncos. The veteran quarterback threw for 294 yards and three touchdowns in what would be the last NFL playoff game played in Los Angeles until the 2017 season, when the LA Rams hosted the Atlanta Falcons in the wild card round. In 1994, Hostetler was voted to his only career Pro Bowl after leading the Raiders to a 9-7 record. With the Raiders back in Oakland for the 1995 campaign, Hostetler got his team off to an impressive 8-2 record. However, a shoulder injury kept him out for all but the final game of the season. The Raiders lost their final six games and finished 8-8.</p><h2>Who is Jeff Hostetler Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jeff Hostetler</strong> married to <strong>Vicky Hostetler </strong>.

Although he was now the starter, he was unable to stay healthy and he only managed 9 starts, playing in four more games, and missed three other games with injuries, including a concussion. While Hostetler had the best record of any Giants starter in 1992, (5-4), he was not retained by the team following the season and signed with the Los Angeles Raiders to be their starter in 1993.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Jeff Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Football Player</strong>.
