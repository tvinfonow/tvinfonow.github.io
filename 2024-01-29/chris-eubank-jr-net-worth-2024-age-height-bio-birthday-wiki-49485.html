Who is Chris Eubank Jr. dating now & how much money does Chris Eubank Jr. have?</p><h2>Chris Eubank Jr. Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Chris Eubank Jr.</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Boxer</strong> who was born on <strong>September 18, 1989</strong> in Hove, England, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. On January 3, 2019, a press conference was held for the announcement of that the James DeGale vs. Chris Eubank Jr. grudge fight, scheduled to be held on February 23rd on The O2 Arena in London exclusive to ITV Box Office, as part of ITV’s partnership together with Haymon Sports’ Premier Boxing Champions.&nbsp;The competition between DeGale (25-2-1 fifteen KOs) and Eubank started just a few months back, following a string of fights, from sparring each other in the gym, to exchanging insults on social media.&nbsp;Discussions about the fight started in July of 2018 following DeGale quit the IBF super middleweight championship.&nbsp;Last time DeGale faced an opponent who was a British boxer was his majority decision defeat against George Groves in May 2011.&nbsp;The fight was initially planned to be held in December of 2018, but an agreement had not yet be reached.&nbsp;The possibility of a fight was first revealed in November of 2018 when PBC revealed its plans to “Invade UK Market’, it was then announced that a pay-per view fight was imminent.&nbsp;Eubank disclosed that he was working out with the Mayweather Boxing Club in Las Vegas at the Mayweather Boxing Club together with the former professional boxer Nate Vasquez, who trains boxers as well as MMA fighters.&nbsp;Eubank stated, “Instead of me going through the motions and trying to beat guys using heart and determination. Now we have strategy involved. This is going to take me to the next level.”&nbsp;International Boxing Organization president Ed Levine confirmed that their super-middleweight title could be in the balance.</p><p>Eubank was victorious in an unanimous decision using the scorecards of 120-108, 120-108, and 118-110.&nbsp;Abraham was unable to provide much most of the time in defense mode, as Eubank defeated and outpointed Abraham.&nbsp;Last time Eubank was able to go the 12-round distance was in his split decision defeat in a split decision to Saunders during November of 2014. The last time he was victorious in by points in a fight was in his 8th professional bout in the month of December.&nbsp;Eubank was able to land a series of stunning uppercuts throughout the fight, some single and others in combination and Abraham only being able to land a handful of shots without causing only a little harm.</p><p>On 15 September 2014, Frank Warren announced that Eubank would challenge fellow unbeaten British rival Billy Joe Saunders for his British, Commonwealth and European titles on the undercard of Tyson Fury vs. Dereck Chisora II on 9 November at the ExCeL arena. The fight was not officially signed as Warren was waiting for Eubank to sign the contract. Warren gave Eubank until 5pm on 25 September. On 3 October the fight was confirmed, but would take place on 29 November instead and would also be a WBO final eliminator.</p><p>On 19 February 2014, Eubank signed a deal to appear on BoxNation, with his first fight being at the York Hall in London on 22 February. Eubank stopped Alistair Warren (0-4-2), after Warren retired on his stool before round 4. Eubank next fought at the Copper Box Arena in London on 12 April against Hungarian boxer Sandor Micsko. Eubank landed a big uppercut in round 2, which dropped Micsko. The referee waved the fight off. In the post-fight, Eubank said, “I’m the next generation. I worked on the uppercut in the gym and I connected beautifully tonight. When I connect with these guys I’m taking them out, no one can stand up to my power and I’ll only get better and stronger. I’m ready for a title fight now.” On 10 May, at the Olympia in Liverpool, Eubank dropped Polish boxer Robert Swierzbinkski (13-2, 3 KOs) seven times, eventually stopping him in round 7. Eubank was then added to a 7 June card, two days prior to it taking place at Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle. It was said that a win would move Eubank closer to a potential grudge match with Billy Joe Saunders, who was challenging for the vacant European title in July. Czech boxer Štěpán Horváth (12-3, 4 KOs) was his opponent. Eubank dropped Horváth four times, stopping him in round 6. This was Eubank’s eighth straight stoppage win.</p><p align=justify>Eubank became a professional in the year 2011, and was signed by his promoter Mick Hennessy.&nbsp;He’s mentored by his father, as well as coach Ronnie Davies who also guided his father.&nbsp;In the following 3 years Eubank recorded a mark of 18-0, with 13 knockouts.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chris Eubank Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chris</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 18</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hove</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Chris Eubank, Karron Eubank</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sebastian Eubank, Joseph Eubank, Emily Eubank</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Chris Eubank Jr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
