He is best known as the leader of the Christian rock band Guardian. He also recorded and performed with the music groups Crunch, AdrianGale, and London Calling.&nbsp;He also released solo albums Songs For Heaven & Earth (2004), and Peppermint Daisy Music (2000).</p><p>Both Rowe and&nbsp;Rowe and his contemporary and fellow musician, <a href=#>John Cooper</a>, both rose to fame as lead singers of popular Christian rock bands.&nbsp;were both famous as lead singers in popular Christian rock bands.</p><p>Billed as “J.R. Rowe,” Rowe began with the band, Tempest, as a teenager in the late 1980s. Their debut album, A Coming Storm, recorded on Pure Metal Records in 1987, features Rowe’s vocals with less grit and more high, falsetto screams (à la metallurgist mentor Stryper’s Michael Sweet) than in his later work, and the lyrics contain a straightforward evangelical candor. The album was not released to compact disc until 1999. Tempest recorded their second and last album, The Eye of the Storm, on Pure Metal in 1988, wherein, looking at the disc insert, Rowe’s former unequivocal lyrics were traded in for those with an ambiguous “you” supplanting references to God in such songs as “True Love (Never Fade Away)” and “Lost Without Your Love.” Amid internal turmoil, Tempest disbanded in 1990.</p><p>Rowe joined the Los Angeles-based band Guardian after being introduced to the band by producers Dino and John Elefante. The first release, 1991’s Fire and Love, was on the Elefante’s Pakaderm label imprint and distributed on Epic Records. The band had moderate success with the video for the song “Power of Love” on MTV’s Headbangers Ball rotation and they toured throughout 1991 and opened a European tour with Stryper in 1992. The band released Miracle Mile in 1993, Swing, Swang, Swung in 1994, Buzz in 1995 and Bottle Rocket. They also released several Spanish-language albums, Nunca Te Dire Adiós (I Will Never Say Goodbye) in 1995, Promesa (Promise) in 1997, Dime in 2001 and recorded several personal projects including The Yellow and Black Attack Is Back!, a tribute to Stryper. In 2014, the band reunited to record and release a new album titled “Almost Home”. The album debuted on the Top 10 Rock Chart on iTunes.</p><p align=justify>His brother, Mikk Rowe (a fellow musician), spent his early years in Evansville.&nbsp;Jamie Rowe – Earl Wilson Rowe Jr. was born in Evansville, Indiana.
