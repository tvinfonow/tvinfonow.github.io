In 1967, at the age of eight, Randy began playing guitar and sang in his Church of Christ choir. Two years later, he and his brother began performing at local clubs and talent contests, calling themselves the Traywick Brothers. Although his father encouraged Travis in his pursuit of music, the two often quarreled, which was a contributing factor in Travis dropping out of high school; he later became a juvenile delinquent and was arrested for various offenses, including auto theft and burglary. However, Travis has since voiced regret for his past misdeeds.</p><p align=justify>He married Elizabeth Hatcher Travis on May 31, 1991.

A second single, “She’s My Woman”, was released in September 1978 and spent four weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, peaking at number 91. A full album on Paula Records was never released. Travis moved in with Hatcher, which put further strain on her already fragile marriage. She eventually left her husband and, in 1982, she and Travis moved to Nashville, Tennessee. During this time an unlikely romance began to form between the two. Travis would later comment, “I think we discovered how much we needed each other.” He and Hatcher eventually came forward with their relationship and were married in a private ceremony in 1991.</p><h2>Randy Travis Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Randy Travis is one of the <strong>richest Country Singer</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Randy Travis</b>'s net worth <strong>$9 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>As a troubled teenager, he was arrested for theft and burglary.&nbsp;Travis was later hired as a performer by Country City USA in Charlotte.</p><p align=justify>Storms of Life, his 1986 album, has been sold over three million times.</p><p align=justify>Randy Bruce Traywick was born on May 4, 1959, in Marshville, North Carolina, USA as the second of six children of Bobbie (née Tucker) (May 16, 1937 – May 21, 1998), a textile factory worker, and Harold Traywick (March 31, 1933 – October 8, 2016), a horse breeder, turkey farmer, substitute school teacher, and construction business owner.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$9 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Country Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Active since 1978, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including sixteen that reached the No.&nbsp;1 position. Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music, Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album Storms of Life, which sold more than four million copies. The album established him as a major force in the neotraditional country movement. Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums. He is known for his distinctive baritone vocals, delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s.</p><p>During the early 1980s, Travis was rejected by every major record label in Nashville. His early demo tapes were criticized by record executives as being “too country.” To support them, Hatcher took a job as manager of a nightclub, The Nashville Palace, and hired Travis as a cook and singer, where he performed under the name Randy Ray. In 1982, Travis recorded an independent album Live at the Nashville Palace, and Hatcher used the album to secure a deal with Warner Bros. Records’ Nashville branch. As part of the contract, label executives insisted they keep their romance a secret, and changed his stage name again, to Randy Travis.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Randy Travis height</b> <strong>5 ft 9 in</strong> Randy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1975, while his brother was serving time in jail for a high-speed car chase, Randy won a talent contest at a nightclub, Country City USA, in Charlotte, North Carolina. The club’s owner, Elizabeth “Lib” Hatcher, took an interest in the young singer, hired him as a cook, and gave him regular singing jobs at the club. During the late 1970s, Randy worked and sang at Country City USA. Still in his late teens, Travis had one more encounter with the law. At his hearing, the judge told Travis that if he ever saw the singer back in his court, he should be prepared to go to jail for a long time. Travis was released into the guardianship of Hatcher, who also became his manager. The two began to focus on his career full-time.</p><p align=justify>Travis’s second album for Warner Bros. was Always & Forever. Released in April 1987, it accounted for four singles, all of which made No.&nbsp;1 at Billboard: “Forever and Ever, Amen” (also co-written by Overstreet), “I Won’t Need You Anymore (Always and Forever)”, “Too Gone Too Long”, and “I Told You So”, the last of which Travis wrote himself. Of these, “Forever and Ever, Amen” held the top position for three weeks. Always & Forever won Travis his first Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1987. Old 8×10, his third album, was issued in July 1988. Its first three singles, “Honky Tonk Moon”, “Deeper Than the Holler”, and “Is It Still Over?”, all reached No.&nbsp;1 as well, while “Promises” was less successful at No.&nbsp;17. The album achieved its highest RIAA certification of double-platinum in 1996, and won Travis his second Grammy, for Best Country Vocal Performance, with Old 8×10 in 1988. This was followed by Travis’s first Christmas album, An Old Time Christmas, late in 1989.</p><h2>Who is Randy Travis Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Randy Travis</strong> married to <strong>Mary Davis , Elizabeth Hatcher-Travis </strong>.

Travis cut the song for a multi-artist tribute album titled Rock, Rhythm & Blues which was also released by Warner Bros., and persuaded the label to include it on what would become his fourth Warner album, No Holdin’ Back. Travis’s version of the song, produced by Richard Perry (who also provided bass vocals on it), was the lead single to that album, and charted at No.&nbsp;1 on Hot Country Songs in December 1989. It was the second time that a rendition of that song had topped the country charts, as Sonny James had previously sent his version to No.&nbsp;1 in 1970. Two more singles were released from No Holdin’ Back: “Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart”, which became Travis’s longest-lasting No.&nbsp;1 single at four weeks in 1990, and “He Walked on Water”, which peaked at No.&nbsp;3. The album included one other cover song, “Singing the Blues”, along with the track “Somewhere in My Broken Heart”, co-written and later recorded by Billy Dean.</p><h3>Did Randy Travis pass away?</h3><p>Despite his remark, <b>Travis is alive and well</b>.</p><h3>Does Randy Travis have children?</h3><p>Despite growing up in a big family, Randy Travis <b>never had any kids</b> he called his own – but this doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to.</p><h3>How much older is Randy's wife?</h3><p>Elizabeth, who is <b>16 years older</b> than Randy, became his manager soon after.
