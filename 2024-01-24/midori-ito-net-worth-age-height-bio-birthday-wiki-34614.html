Midori Ito, or Midori Ito (Yi Teng Midori, Ito Midori) is a former Japanese figure skater.&nbsp;She is the 1989 World champion, and 1992 Olympic silver medalist.&nbsp;She is the first woman in competition to achieve a triple triple jump combination.&nbsp;She became the first woman in 1988 to win seven triple jumps at an Olympic free skating competition.</p><p>Ito won her national championship in 1985, but she was unable to compete at the World Championships that year due to a broken ankle.&nbsp;She increased her attempts at triple jumps in the long program.&nbsp;Ito’s free skating included seven triple jumps from 1985 to 1987. However, she did not always do them correctly.&nbsp;She attempted a triple-toe loop-triple jump combination, a Lutz jumping, flip jumping, a loop jump and a Salchow jump together with another solo Salchow.</p><p>During the start of the 1989–90 season, Ito made history again at the 1989 NHK Trophy competition, where she received a rare 6.0 technical/6.0 artistic score from the Hungarian judge, and again landed seven triples, including the triple axel. At the 1990 World Championships, Ito was 10th after the compulsory figures but placed first in both the short program and the free skate and won the silver medal, second to Jill Trenary. She landed seven triple jumps in the free skate, including the triple Axel. Compulsory figures were eliminated from competitions following that season. Ito commented: “In training, I spend about two-thirds of my time on the figures. So I will sort of miss them as part of my life. But I will not miss them in the actual event.” In June 1990, she was invited to meet Emperor Akihito.</p><p>During the peak of her career, Ito performed much the same jump content as the top male skaters of the time. She was the first ladies’ skater to perform a triple-triple jump combination and the first to perform the triple Axel. In March 1990, Jill Trenary said, “I was in awe of how high she jumps.” In 1990, Scott Hamilton said “it will be 50 years before we see anything like Midori Ito again,” and Toller Cranston, the same year, noted that “she is beyond 6.0.”</p><p align=justify>Ito didn’t compete in the 1983 World Junior event. It took place in December 1982. Ito had broken her ankle earlier that year.&nbsp;She made her senior international debut in the Ennia Challenge Cup, which was held in the Netherlands in the fall 1983. This competition featured a short program and free skating, with no compulsory figures.&nbsp;Katarina Witt won the Olympic title two months later, finishing second to her.&nbsp;Ito’s free skate included six triple jumps: flip, Lutz loop, loop, Salchow and two toe loops. She also did a double loop-triple combination in the short program.&nbsp;She won the short program and free skate at the 1984 World Junior Championships but was third overall due to her low ranking in the compulsory figures.&nbsp;Ito also participated in the 1984 World Championships where she placed 7th.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Midori Ito</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Midori</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ito</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Figure Skater</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 13</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nagoya</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aichi Prefecture</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Japan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Masaru Yamaki</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Midori Ito ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In February 1991, she underwent surgery to remove two glandular cysts in her throat and was in the hospital for 18 days. In March, at the 1991 World Championships, Ito collided with France’s Laetitia Hubert during a practice session – her hip and the top of her foot were bruised. In the short program, she placed her jump combination too close to the corner of the rink and fell into the opening in the boards for the television camera but was back on the ice within seconds. She finished 4th at the event.</p><h2>Midori Ito Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Midori Ito is one of the <strong>richest Figure Skater</strong> from Japan. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Midori Ito</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Ito was at the 1981 World Junior Championships when she made her debut at an international competition.&nbsp;Ito placed 20th in the compulsory figures, but won the free skate with a triple loop and a triple salchow.&nbsp;She was 8th overall.&nbsp;The 11-year old Ito weighed 53 lbs and was just 3’11 tall.&nbsp;Due to her small stature and strong jumps, she was called the “Jumping Flea”.</p><p align=justify>Ito was 6th overall at the 1982 World Junior Championships. She won the free and short programs, but her compulsory figures were weak.&nbsp;She also did a triple flip, triple toe loop-triple loop combination and landed a triple Lutz at the exhibition.</p><p align=justify>Ito placed 5th at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. In Calgary, she performed a double loop-triple loop in the short program, and seven triples in the free skating: Lutz, flip, double axel-half loop-triple Salchow combination, loop, triple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, and another Salchow. She received the best technical scores given, two 5.8 and seven 5.9 marks, despite skating before the final flight. Her successful seven triple jumps were two more than any of the other skaters even attempted. Later that same year, she perfected the triple Axel, which she had been working on since her early teens, and landed it at a regional competition in the Aichi prefecture. She became the first woman to land it in international competition at the 1988 NHK Trophy. She then repeated the feat at the World Championships in 1989. Ito thus became the first woman to execute all six possible triple jumps in World competition: Axel, Lutz, flip, loop, Salchow and toe loop. She was 6th in the compulsory figures but made up for it. She won the gold medal with a flawless free skate when she received 6.0s for technical merit from five of the nine judges, receiving 5.9s from the rest. Her win at the 1989 World Championships was the first world title in the sport for an Asian competitor.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Figure Skater</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The 1992 Winter Olympics did not include the compulsory figures which caused Ito to lose the World championships the year before even after winning the short program and free skate competitions. With only the short program and the free skate to perform, she became the heiress apparent to Katarina Witt. She planned to perform the triple Axel combined with a double toe loop for the jump combination requirement in the short program but changed it to a triple Lutz combination. Ito placed fourth in the short program when she fell on her triple Lutz jump. In comparison, Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan completed their triple Lutz-double toe loop combinations and then placed one and two, respectively. The change may have an interesting origin. During a practice session, Surya Bonaly of France performed a back flip near her. Ito was nearly hit on the head and was obviously shaken. Subsequently, her practice with her triple Axel jumps turned out poorly, which may have led her to take it out of the original program. Ito’s free skate began with a failed triple Axel but she attempted it again at the end of her program and landed it successfully, becoming the first woman to land one in the Olympics. She won the silver medal, and apologized to her country for not winning the gold. Ito turned professional afterwards, bringing the triple Axel for the first time to the professional ranks, and performed with ice shows in Japan. She briefly returned to competitive skating in the 1995–96 season, but without her former success.</p><p>Ito lit the Olympic flame during the opening ceremonies of the 1998 Winter Olympics.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Midori Ito height</b> <strong>4 ft 9 in</strong> Midori <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>4 ft 9 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At the 1991 Grand Prix International de Paris – a pre-Olympic event in Albertville – Ito beat Kristi Yamaguchi by completing a triple axel and five other triple jumps in her free skating.
