Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for improperly administering the anesthetic drug that led to Jackson’s death and served two years of a four-year prison sentence.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>-$500 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doctor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On June 25, 2009, only weeks after hiring Murray, Michael Jackson died due to a lethal dose of propofol administered by Murray. Court documents released in August 2009 revealed that the coroner’s preliminary conclusion indicated that Jackson overdosed on propofol. However, the coroner’s office declined to comment on reports claiming that the death was ruled a homicide. Several offices of doctors who were believed to have treated Jackson were searched. Based on the autopsy and toxicology findings, the cause of Jackson’s death was determined to be acute propofol intoxication with a contributory benzodiazepine effect and the manner of death to be a homicide, eventually, so that the focus of the investigation shifted toward Murray. He admitted administering 25&nbsp;mg of propofol intravenously, for insomnia, on the night of Jackson’s death. He claimed that he tried treating him with other drugs and that he only administered the propofol after Jackson insisted, according to a police affidavit. Murray said he worried that Jackson had become dependent on the drug as a sleep aid, and was trying to wean him from it. Propofol is usually given in a hospital or a clinical setting with close monitoring, mostly used for general anesthesia during surgery, is not indicated or approved as a sleep aid and is administered only by anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists or anesthesia assistants who have extensive training in the use and monitoring of anesthetics. Murray had no such training at all.</p><p>At the time that he began working for Jackson in May 2009, Murray had reportedly fathered seven children by six different women. He was in arrears on the mortgage for the Las Vegas home occupied by his first wife and children and owed child support to the mothers of children outside of his marriage, which he could not pay due to the amount of money he owed to Michael Jackson’s family. He was married to Blanche, his second wife, whom he met at medical school, and helped pay rent for another woman, Nicole Alvarez. Murray met Alvarez at a gentlemen’s club in Las Vegas when she worked as a stripper, and Alvarez gave birth to their son Che Giovanni Murray in March 2009. Another relationship, with a cocktail waitress from Houston, was also reported.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Conrad Murray height</b> Not available right now.
