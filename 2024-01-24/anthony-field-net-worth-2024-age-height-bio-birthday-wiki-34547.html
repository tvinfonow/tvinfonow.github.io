A founding participant of the children’s musical group The Wiggles who was named the 1999 Bachelor of the Year by Cleo Magazine.</p><p><a href=#>Greg Page</a> was another member of The Wiggles.&nbsp;was an additional member Of The Wiggles.</p><p>Field was born in Kellyville, New South Wales, Australia. He is the youngest of seven children, and grew up in north western Sydney. He came from a long line of musicians, especially the women in his family. His great-great aunt was “Queenie Paul”, known for performing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, and his grandmother Kathleen accompanied silent movies in the mining town of Cobar. Field’s mother, Marie, made sure that all of her seven children learned how to play at least one musical instrument. He attended the all-boys boarding school St. Joseph’s College, which his great-grandfather Paddy Condon, an Italian immigrant and master stonemason, helped build. In 1979, while they were students at St. Joseph’s, he and his brothers Paul and John formed the pop group the Cockroaches.</p><p>He was inspired by his sister Colleen to study early childhood education, and became convinced that teaching preschool children “was my calling”. He was also attracted to the profession’s freedom, artistic nature, and lack of discipline, which was different from his experience in boarding school. Field put off university when the Cockroaches became successful, but he was dissatisfied with touring and plagued by “perhaps irrational, but very real, feelings of inadequacy and depression”. By his mid-twenties, he decided that he did not want to tour any longer, so he took two breaks. His first break was as an infantry soldier, medic, and rifleman in the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Australia’s regular army from 1982 to 1985. He played the bagpipes in parades and on training missions, but ended his military service in July 1985 and suffered from a bad back as a result of his training. He also went backpacking in the U.K., listening to roots music, to children’s music by artists like Raffi, and to recordings of children’s books.</p><p align=justify>He got married to Michaela Patisteas in 2003.&nbsp;They have three children, who all appeared on stage in the band The Wiggles.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=5.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Anthony Field</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Anthony</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Field</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1963</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kellyville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oklahoma</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marie Field, John Patrick Field</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Paul Field, John Field, Colleen Field</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michaela Patisteas</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lucia Maria Angela Field, Marie Claire Field, Antonio Carlos Field</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Anthony Field ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

While at university, he decided to record an album of children’s music, enlisting the assistance of fellow student and guitarist Murray Cook, former Cockroaches roadie and vocalist Greg Page, former bandmate and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, and Macquarie instructor and composer Phillip Wilcher, who later left the group.</p><h2>Anthony Field Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Anthony Field is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

He is best known as a member of the children’s group the Wiggles and a member of the 1980s and 1990s pop band the Cockroaches. While still a teenager, he helped found the Cockroaches with his brothers, Paul and John. The Cockroaches recorded two albums and enjoyed moderate success, interrupted by Field’s service in Australia’s regular army, until they disbanded in the late 1980s.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Wiggles recorded their first CD in 1991; it sold 100,000 copies. Field worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles and their extensive touring schedule, which he strongly disliked, forced him to quit. After the production of their second album, the Wiggles adopted colour-coded shirts to wear on stage. According to Field, he wore blue because Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours of red and purple respectively, so he and Page “met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt”. Page ended up wearing a yellow shirt and Field originally wore a green polo shirt, but changed to blue to avoid clashing with Dorothy the Dinosaur.</p><p>Field attended Macquarie University to receive training in early childhood education, and founded the Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher for two years before the success of the Wiggles led him to focus on children’s music full-time. Despite Field’s strong dislike of touring, the Wiggles became one of the most successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Anthony Field height</b> <strong>6 ft 0 in</strong> Anthony <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 0 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By the mid-1990s, despite the success of the Wiggles, Field reported being suicidal and “frequently gripped by anxiety, sadness, and negativity”. By mid-2004, shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child, Field’s serious medical issues, worsened by their heavy tour schedule, caused him to consider quitting or re-inventing the Wiggles, despite their great success in the U.K. and North America. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago in 2004, Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements. In early 2013, Field became the only original member of the group to remain after Fatt, Cook, and Page retired. He remained in the group because he wanted to continue to educate children and as Wiggles manager Paul Field stated, “to placate American, British and Canadian business partners”.</p><p align=justify>In 1999, Field was named “Bachelor of the Year” in Cleo Magazine. In 2003, he married Michaela Patisteas, a former dancer whose family owned Griffiths Coffee in Melbourne. They have three children, who have joined the Field family business by appearing in several of the Wiggles’ TV shows and videos. Beginning in 2007, Field, who is a registered breeder of Miniature Fox Terriers, did some voiceover work for the TV show “RSPCA Animal Rescue,” for Channel 7 in Australia.</p><h2>Who is Anthony Field Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Anthony Field</strong> married to <strong>Michaela Patisteas </strong>.
