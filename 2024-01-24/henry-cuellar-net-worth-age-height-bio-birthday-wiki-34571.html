Cuellar was born and raised in Laredo in South Texas. He has lived there most of his adult life.&nbsp;Martin Siller Cuellar Sr., his Mexican-American parents (1926-1999), and Odilia Perez (1928-1915), were both born in Laredo. Odilia, a native of Zapata (Texas), traveled to Idaho every year as migrant laborer until Martin was hired as a ranch manager and gardener.&nbsp;The Cuellar family, which included eight children, lived on Reynolds Street in “The Heights” Laredo.&nbsp;Although the parents did not speak English, they instilled in their children a strong work ethic.</p><p>Cuellar represented Laredo’s major part of Texas House of Representatives, from 1987 to 2001.&nbsp;Cuellar was Laredo’s state representative for 14 years. He held leadership positions on the House Appropriations and Higher Education committees.&nbsp;He was also a member of several national legislative panels that dealt with the state budgets, U.S./Mexico border and international trade.</p><p>In 2001, Cuellar was appointed as Secretary of State of Texas by Republican Governor Rick Perry, serving in the position for eight months.</p><p>In the 2002 election, Cuellar was the Democratic nominee for the House of Representatives in Texas’s 23rd congressional district. He lost to five-term incumbent Republican Henry Bonilla by 52–47 in the closest race Bonilla had faced up to that date. Bonilla was unseated in 2006 in the revised 23rd District by the liberal Democrat Ciro Rodriguez.</p><p align=justify>Cuellar started his own law practice in Laredo in 1982 and was licensed as a customs broker in 1983.&nbsp;From 1984 to 1986, he was an adjunct professor in International Commercial Law at Texas A&M International University.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henry Cuellar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Henry</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cuellar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Laredo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Texas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Martin Cuellar, Rosie Cuellar-Castillo</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Imelda Cuellar</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Catherine Ann Cuellar, Christina Alexandra Cuellar</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Henry Cuellar ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In November, he defeated Republican Jim Hopson of Seguin by a 20-point margin, becoming the first Laredoan in over 20 years elected to represent the 28th District of Texas. Cuellar’s election to the House in 2004 was a standout for Democrats in a year in which Republicans otherwise gained seats in Texas’s delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><h2>Henry Cuellar Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Henry Cuellar is one of the <strong>richest Politician</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Henry Cuellar</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Enrique Roberto “Henry” Cuellar, born September 19, 1955, is an American politician currently serving the U.S. Representative for Texas’s 28th district. This position he held since 2005.&nbsp;He is a member the Democratic Party.&nbsp;It extends from San Antonio’s Rio Grande to its suburbs.</p><p align=justify>Cuellar was a student at Buenos Aires Elementary School. He became an avid reader and graduated from J. W. Nixon high school in 1973, a classmate with future Webb County District attorney Joe Rubio Jr.&nbsp;Cuellar received an associate in arts degree from Laredo Community College, which was then known as Laredo Junior College. He later taught courses on government.&nbsp;After graduating from Laredo Community College, he attended Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., where he received a bachelor of science degree in foreign service.&nbsp;He holds a master’s in International Trade from Texas A&M International University, Laredo, and a Juris Doctor at the University of Texas School of Law. Also, he has a Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p align=justify>Cuellar’s two main political rivals, Bonilla and Rodriguez, ran against each other in the 23rd, and Rodriguez won the election in the runoff. The Republican Bonilla was hence out of Congress for the first time since his upset election in 1992.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the general election on November 7, 2006, Cuellar had no Republican opposition but handily defeated Ron Avery of McQueeney, the chairman of the conservative Constitution Party in Guadalupe County and trial attorney and Democrat Frank Enriquez of McAllen by taking nearly 68 percent of the more than 77,000 votes cast in the House race.</p><p>On June 29, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the Texas Legislature had violated the rights of Latino voters when it shifted most of Laredo out of the 23rd and replaced it with several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs. As a result, nearly every congressional district from El Paso to San Antonio had to be redrawn, and the primary results for these districts were invalidated. A court drew a new map in which all of Laredo was moved into the 28th district while the south San Antonio area was moved to the 23rd. An election open to all candidates with a runoff if no candidate won 50% was scheduled for the date of the general election, November 7, 2006.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Henry Cuellar height</b> Not available right now.

The 2003 Texas redistricting, however, shifted most of Laredo, which had been the heart of the 23rd since its creation in 1966, into the 28th district, represented by Ciro Rodriguez. Cuellar challenged Rodriguez, a former friend, for the nomination and won it by fifty-eight votes. The Washington Post described the campaign as “nasty … with Cuellar claiming Rodriguez was an AWOL congressman, while Rodriguez called Cuellar a political opportunist”. The initial count gave Rodriguez a 145-vote lead, but after a recount Cuellar led by 58 votes. “Rodriguez filed a lawsuit questioning the eligibility of hundreds of votes. A state appeals court ruling against Rodriguez guaranteed Cuellar the nomination.” Cuellar’s victory was one of only two primary upsets of incumbents, from either party, in the entire country.</p><p align=justify>On June 15, 2007, Cuellar announced that he was endorsing then U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton for President in 2008, saying that “Senator Clinton is the only candidate with the experience and toughness to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House.” In 2007, Cuellar held a fundraiser for Clinton in Laredo, which raised over $200,000 – aided by the presence of former President Bill Clinton. Laredo’s Democratic Mayor Raul G. Salinas joined Cuellar in giving his early support to Hillary Clinton, who came to Laredo in October 2008 to endorse Cuellar’s reelection to the U.S. House. On November 4, 2008, Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Webb County with 71% of the vote to McCain’s 28%.</p><h2>Who is Henry Cuellar Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Henry Cuellar</strong> married to <strong>Imelda Cuellar</strong>.
