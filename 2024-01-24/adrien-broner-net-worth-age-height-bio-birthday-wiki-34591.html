Who is Adrien Broner dating now & how much money does Adrien Broner have?</p><h2>Adrien Broner Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Adrien Broner</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Boxer</strong> who was born on <strong>July 28, 1989</strong> in Cincinnati, Ohio, <strong>United States</strong>. World champion boxer known for his quickness and shoulder roll defense. He earned the WBO super featherweight title, WBC lightweight title, and WBA welterweight title.</p><p>Early in his career he drew many comparisons to <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a>, who he considers to be his boxing idol.</p><p>On November 5, 2017, according to Alex Vaysfeld, manager of IBF light welterweight champion Sergey Lipinets (13-0, 10 KOs), Broner was being targeted as a first defence for March 2018. Lipinets won the then-vacant title on November 4 against Japanese boxer Akihiro Kondo. On December 18, The Ring TV reported that a deal was being discussed which would match Broner against Omar Figueroa Jr. (27-0-1, 19 KOs) on Showtime in the Spring of 2018. On January 24, Showtime announced Broner vs. Figueroa would take place on April 21 at the Barclays Center in New York. On March 4, Figueroa pulled out of the fight after injuring his shoulder in training. PBC stated the card would still go ahead and they would find a new opponent for Broner. The next day, Showtime confirmed that Broner would now fight former two-weight world champion Jessie Vargas (28-2, 10 KOs) in a 144-pound catchweight bout, headlining a card also featuring the re-booked Jermall Charlo-Hugo Centeno Jr. fight and Gervonta Davis-Jesús Cuellar.</p><p>Broner was set to make his first title defense on February 16, 2013, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. Having no luck at getting fellow Lightweight champion Ricky Burns to fight him in February, Broner fought Ring No. 6-ranked lightweight and former WBA champion Gavin Rees (37-1-1, 18 KOs) instead. The fight was announced in December 2012, with many believing it to be a mismatch, to take place at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There was a crowd of 4,812 at Boardwalk Hall and both Broner and Rees weighed 150 pounds in their dressing rooms before the fight. Broner stopped Rees in five rounds, after Rees’ corner threw in the towel at the end of the round. Rees had some success early, when Broner was clowning and showboating, landing jabs and body shots. By round 3, Broner was in complete control, hitting Rees with his counter left hook at will, as well as hitting Rees at will on the inside. In the 4th round, Broner sent Rees to the canvas with a quick right uppercut, and landed more combinations as the round ended. In the 5th, after a brief clinch between the two, they separated and Broner landed a hard left body shot on Rees, dropping Rees to a knee. Broner ended the round teeing off on Rees, with Rees’ trainer throwing in the towel from the corner. CompuBox had Broner landing 48% of his punches in the fight, as well as ending the fight landing 40 of 57 in the final round.</p><p align=justify>He grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. He and Arienne Gazaway, also known as Arie Nicole, got engaged in November 2015.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Adrien Broner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Adrien</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Broner</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 28</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cincinnati</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Na’Riya Broner, Armani Broner, Admire Broner, Adrien Broner Jr., KJ Broner</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Adrien Broner ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Going into the fight, Broner was 4–0 at the arena. Prior to the fight, Broner spoke about how he didn’t expect Maidana, the only boxer to beat him professionally, to fight him again, although he wanted to avenge the loss. Broner lost a unanimous decision to Porter with scores of 118–108, 115–111, and 114–112. In the 11th round Broner was deducted a point for excessive holding. Porter who dominated the majority of the fight, was sent to the canvas by Broner in the 12th round. The knockdown was not enough to secure Broner the win, as the fight was one-sided for the majority of the rounds. Leading up the fight the welterweight champ Porter also criticized, that Broner had a 157 lbs. limit clause in the contract, which stopped Porter from rehydrating to his normal weight on fight day. Porter was quoted as saying,“You want to move up into my weight, then move up! Don’t be scared. Don’t be worried. Don’t be afraid. Put your skill on the line along with your record. Put it all on the line at 147. Don’t put it at 144, then not want to talk about it.” The remarks came as Broner had repeatedly refused to comment on the catchweight situation, which many believed would put Broner in a negative light. The fight drew close to 2.4 million viewers. Broner had a purse of $1.35 million compared to Porter’s $1 million.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$9 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Broner later apologized, saying, “I’m sorry for running out on all the fans after my fight.

In the early rounds, Broner was able to hit DeMarco with his quick counter left hook several times. By the 4th round, Broner and DeMarco decided to stand toe-to-toe in the center of the ring and trade punches. It was Broner who got the better of the inside fight though, with his speed and quick combination punching taking its toll on DeMarco. By the 6th round, DeMarco was cut and his face was swollen in several places while still standing toe-to-toe with Broner, with Broner barely missing his right uppercuts and working the body of DeMarco as well.
