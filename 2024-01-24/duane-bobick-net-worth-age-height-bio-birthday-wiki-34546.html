A good puncher who developed well early by virtue of countless hours in the gym and ring, Bobick had an outstanding amateur career that included a win over Teófilo Stevenson at the 1971 Pan American Games. Bobick added another future champion to his list when he beat Larry Holmes to be named to the 1972 U.S. Olympic boxing team. But lurking on Bobick’s amateur record were two devastating second-round one-punch knockout losses at the hands of future heavyweight contender Ron Lyle. The first time, Lyle dispatched of him at the national AAU quarterfinals. The second time, fighting for a spot on the national team, Bobick was dropped with a straight right at 30 seconds of the second round, and was unconscious in the ring for over five minutes.</p><p>Inter-service Championships, Mare Island, California, April 1971:</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Duane Bobick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Shaji</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kailas</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Boxer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 24</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Little Falls Township</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Minnesota</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rodney Bobick</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Debbie Bobick</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Duane Bobick ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was a three-time Navy Heavyweight Champion, two-time All-Service Heavyweight Champion and two-time International Military champion. He was touted as a rising star at this early stage, and may have been overconfident as he met Stevenson again at the 1972 Olympics. The fight was even after two rounds with Stevenson getting the edge in round one and Bobick rallying in round two. In the third round, Bobick fell victim to a nemesis that would bedevil him for the rest of his boxing career, the overhand right. Stunned, floored and eventually defenseless, Bobick was pounded by the Cuban champion until the bout was stopped; this was Bobick’s last bout as an amateur. By that time he had a record of 93 wins (60 by KO) and 10 losses.</p><h2>Duane Bobick Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Duane Bobick is one of the <strong>richest Boxer</strong> from United States.
