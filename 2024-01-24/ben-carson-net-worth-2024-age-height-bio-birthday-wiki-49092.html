According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Ben Carson</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was a student at Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School.</p><p align=justify>The book was released by the author America the Beautiful: Rediscovering the Factors that It Was That Made This Nation Great in 2011.</p><p align=justify>Carson was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Robert Solomon Carson, Jr. (1914–1992), a World War II U.S. Army veteran, and his wife, Sonya Carson (née Copeland; 1928–2017). Robert Carson was a Baptist minister, but later a Cadillac automobile plant laborer. Both his parents came from large families in rural Georgia, and they were living in rural Tennessee when they met and married. Carson’s mother was 13 and his father was 28 when they married, and after his father finished his military service, they moved from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Detroit, where they lived in a large house in the Indian Village neighborhood. Carson’s older brother, Curtis, was born in 1949, when his mother was 20. In 1950, Carson’s parents purchased a new 733-square foot single-family detached home on Deacon Street in the Boynton neighborhood in southwest Detroit.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doctor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Carson does not say in his books whether he received a college student deferment during the Vietnam War. He does say that his older brother, then a student at the University of Michigan, received a low number (26) in the first draft lottery in 1969 and was able to enlist in the Navy for four years instead of being drafted, whereas he received a high number (333) in the second draft lottery in 1970. Carson said he would have readily accepted his responsibility to fight had he been drafted, but he “identified strongly with the antiwar protesters and the revolutionaries” and enthusiastically voted for antiwar Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern in 1972. In his book, America the Beautiful (2012), Carson said: “The Vietnam War was, in retrospect, not a noble conflict. It brought shame to our nation because of both the outcome and the cause.”</p><p>Carson and his wife, Lacena “Candy” Rustin, met in 1971 as students at Yale University and married in 1975. They began living in West Friendship, Maryland in 1988. Together, the couple have three sons (Rhoeyce, Benjamin Jr., and Murray), as well as several grandchildren.

When they returned to Detroit public schools, Carson and his brother’s academic performance initially lagged far behind their new classmates, having according to Carson “essentially lost a year of school” by attending the small Seventh-day Adventist parochial school in Boston, but both improved when their mother limited their time watching television and required them to read and write book reports on two library books per week. Carson attended the predominantly white Higgins Elementary School for fifth and sixth grades and the predominantly white Wilson Junior High School for seventh and the first half of eighth grade. In 1965, when Carson was 13, he moved with his mother and brother back to their house on Deacon Street. He attended the predominantly black Hunter Junior High School for the second half of eighth grade. When he was eight, Carson had dreamed of becoming a missionary doctor, but five years later he aspired to the lucrative lifestyles of psychiatrists portrayed on television, and his brother bought him a subscription to Psychology Today for his 13th birthday.</p><p align=justify>Carson’s SAT college admission test scores ranked him somewhere in the low 90th percentile, which according to him resulted in a Detroit Free Press article “Carson Gets Highest SAT Scores in Twenty Years” of any student in Detroit public schools. He wanted to attend college farther away than his brother who was at the University of Michigan. Carson says he narrowed his college choices to Harvard or Yale, but could only afford the $10 application fee to apply for one of them. He said he decided to apply to Yale after seeing a team from Yale defeat a team from Harvard on the G.E. College Bowl television show. Carson was accepted by Yale and offered a full scholarship covering tuition, room and board. In 1973, Carson graduated with a B.A. in psychology from Yale “with a fairly respectable grade point average, although far from the top of the class.”</p><h2>Who is Ben Carson Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Ben Carson</strong> married to <strong>Candy Carson </strong>.
