Some online communities criticized her comments as disingenuous, arguing that her professional career was born from nepotism, and thus she should not be considered a true DIY musician. They accused her of being an “industry plant”, an artist who has backing from the music industry to advance or kick-start their career, but are deceptively presented as an independent start-up. Such discussion appeared mostly on Reddit. One of the widely shared posts lamented that, although the user enjoyed her music and thought she was an “inspiring” songwriter, they could not fathom why none of her articles and interviews acknowledged her father’s significant industry connections.</p><h2>Clairo Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Clairo is one of the <strong>richest Pop Singer</strong> from United States.

He signed Clairo to the magazine’s associated record label and introduced her to Pat Corcoran, manager of Chance the Rapper. Corcoran’s talent agency Haight Brand enlisted her as a client near the end of 2017.</p><p>Clairo first drew wide attention in late 2017 when the video for her song “Pretty Girl” went viral on YouTube.

I used like a little keyboard that I had and I was really into ’80s pop music — my mom is obsessed with it — so it kind of inspired me to do something like that.” She attributed the interest in the video to YouTube’s algorithm system.
