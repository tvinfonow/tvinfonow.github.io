Mabel Martine Los was her mother. She was born in Pijnacker (the Netherlands).&nbsp;Her parents were Hendrik Cornelis Los (27 April 1944 – 18 February 1978) as well as Florence Malde Gijsberdina Kooman (b.&nbsp;1944) (the daughter and son of Anthonie Kooman (15 June 1915 – 8 November 1979), and his wife Antoinette Petronella Van Woerkom.&nbsp;Mabel was nine years old when her father died.

In 1995 she was present at the peace conference in Dayton, Ohio.</p><p>After announcing the engagement of Prince Friso with Mabel in June 2003, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende wrote in a letter to parliament that Mabel Wisse Smit had given “incomplete and incorrect information” about the duration and extent of her contacts with known drug lord, Klaas Bruinsma, and that because of this, the government had decided not to seek permission for the marriage from parliament. In a letter to the Prime Minister dated 9 October, Prince Friso stated that the couple had given some incomplete information, but had not given any incorrect information nor did they lie. The couple admitted that the sailing friendship with Bruinsma was indeed closer than had been mentioned, but denied a love or sexual relationship.
