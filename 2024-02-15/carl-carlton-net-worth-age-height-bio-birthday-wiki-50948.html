Who is Carl Carlton dating now & how much money does Carl Carlton have?</p><h2>Carl Carlton Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Carl Carlton</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Composer</strong> who was born on <strong>April 20, 1955</strong> in Ihrhove, Ihrhove, <strong>Germany</strong>. Carl Carlton (born Karl Walter Ahlerich Buskohl, 20 April 1955, Ihrhove, East Frisia, Germany) is a German rock musician, guitarist, composer and producer who has played in top international bands and with many well-known musicians. His collaboration with Robert Palmer culminated in the Grammy nominated album Drive, which was released in 2003. In 2005, Carlton joined Eric Burdon and the Animals. The collaboration resulted in the Grammy nominated album Soul of a Man, which was released in 2006. Carlton has released four albums with his own band, Carl Carlton and the Songdogs.</p><p>Martin Huch, a multi-instrumentalist, was soon hired along with Wayne P. Sheehy for live performances. It was at the end of the Love & Respect tour that Carlton collapsed from exhaustion due to an unrelenting work schedule. The incident was caught live by television cameras. Several weeks later, in the midst of doing PR for the Drive album, Robert Palmer died suddenly. The next Songdogs album, Cahoots & Roots, was released in 2005. Also in 2005, Carlton joined Eric Burdon and The Animals and recorded a blues album called Soul of a Man with Ivan Neville, James “Hutch” Hutchinson, Ricky Fataar, and Mike Finnegan. It too was nominated for a Grammy. Carlton, who in the meantime had given up his second home in Mallorca and taken up residence on the island of Gozo near Malta, began making a fourth album called Songs for the Lost and Brave, whose fifteen tracks explored the many bitter blows dealt to Carlton in recent years. This included a divorce from his second wife. By this time, Zack Alford, a drummer who had played for both Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie, had been added to the band, which was invited by Levon Helm, one of Carlton’s closest friends, to record the new album at Helm’s studio in Woodstock, New York. One of the album’s tracks, a cover of Stephen Stills’ “For What Its Worth”, included the voices of Carlton’s son, Max Buskohl, and Eric Burdon. Carlton and his son also joined together for a track on Klaus Voormann’s album, A Sideman’s Journey.</p><p align=justify>In the early 1990s, Carlton and longtime musical partner Bertram Engel, a drummer, formed a band called New Legend, which also included keyboardist Pascal Kravetz and the two Dutch blues rockers Harry de Winter and Peter Bootsmann. Two CDs were released before the band broke up two years later due to personality conflicts. In 1994, Carlton took up residence in Dublin, which at the time was one of the few pulsating metropolises for music in Europe. In 1999, Carlton again formed a band of his own, Carl Carlton and the Songdogs, which consisted of a multi-national line-up of musicians. In 2001, Carlton convinced Robert Palmer, whom he had worked with previously as one of his guitar players, to record a version of “Milk Cow’s Calf Blues” with him as part of a tribute album to Robert Johnson. The resulting compilation, Hellhound On My Trail, was nominated for a Grammy. Its success convinced Palmer and Carlton to co-produce another pure blues album, the Grammy-nominated Drive, in 2003. Drive was also named one of Billboard’s Top Ten Blues albums for that year.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carl Carlton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carl</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carl</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Composer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ihrhove</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ihrhove</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Max Buskohl</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Carl Carlton ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
