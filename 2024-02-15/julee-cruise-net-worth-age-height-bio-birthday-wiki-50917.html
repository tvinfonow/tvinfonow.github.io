American singer and actress , best famous for her performance of the theme tune for the TV series Twin Peaks.&nbsp;In 2014, she’s made four album releases.</p><p>She worked together with&nbsp;She collaborated with <a href=#>David Lynch</a> on several projects.&nbsp;on numerous projects.</p><p>In 1985, Badalamenti was composing the score for David Lynch’s Blue Velvet, as well as serving as the vocal coach for the film’s star, Isabella Rossellini. A key scene in Blue Velvet was intended to feature This Mortal Coil’s version of “Song to the Siren” by Tim Buckley, but when the rights to the song proved prohibitively expensive, it was suggested that Badalamenti compose a pop song in the same style, with lyrics written by Lynch. Because the song required a vocalist with a haunting, ethereal voice, Badalamenti recommended Cruise, who had sung in a New York theater workshop Badalamenti had produced. The result of their initial collaboration was “Mysteries of Love”, which figures prominently in Blue Velvet’s closing scenes and gained a cult following.</p><p>Badalamenti and Lynch went on to write and produce additional songs for Cruise, most of which were featured in her debut album, Floating into the Night (1989). The album was released on 12 September 1989 by Warner Bros. Records, and charted on Billboard the following year. It also provided musical material for Lynch’s Industrial Symphony No. 1, in which Cruise performed while “floating” from a harness dozens of feet above a stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p><p align=justify>She got married Christian writer and journalist Edward Grinnan.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Julee Cruise</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Julee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cruise</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1956</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Creston</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Iowa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Julee Cruise ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
