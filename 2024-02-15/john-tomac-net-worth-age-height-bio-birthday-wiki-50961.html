Who is John Tomac dating now & how much money does John Tomac have?</p><h2>John Tomac Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>John Tomac</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Sport Cyclist</strong> who was born on <strong>November 3, 1967</strong> in Owosso, Michigan, <strong>United States</strong>. John Tomac (born November 3 1967, from Owosso, Michigan) is an American retired professional cyclist who participated in a variety of disciplines including mountain biking and road racing in a career that ran for twenty years.&nbsp;Tomac is considered an icon of mountain biking and was admitted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in the year 1991.&nbsp;He is an all-rounder, winning major world and national championships in four different disciplines.</p><p>From 1988 to 1991 Tomac worked with professional programs in road and mountain biking.&nbsp;Tomac had been an 1988 USCF National Criterium Champion and was part of the winning team at the USCF National Team Time Trial Championship in 1989.&nbsp;Tomac was a major part of the year 1990 participating in European races with his Motorola team.&nbsp;While he did not win any of the major road championships in an event calendar that participated in more than 100 mountain and road events, his schedule comprised those events such as the Tour of Flanders, the Giro d’Italia and Paris-Roubaix.&nbsp;Tomac stopped participating in professional road racing towards the end in the season of 1991 opting to concentrate on his mountain cycling career.</p><p>Tomac retained his overall NORBA title in 1989, and also won the NORBA DH Championship for the first time. In a season in which he competed at the highest level on both sides of the Atlantic, he added the German and European XC titles to his collection. In 1990, he joined Yeti Cycles’ factory MTB team and the 7-11 road team, embarking on a busy program of events in Europe and the U.S. To facilitate his road racing career, Tomac based himself in Belgium, and regularly traveled between the two continents to compete in major road and mountain events. Although he failed to win any of the three individual NORBA series, he won the overall NORBA title for the third year in succession.</p><p>1991 saw a change of teams: from Yeti to Raleigh and from 7-11 to Motorola. A stronger mountain bike season culminated in UCI World Championship success in Ciocco, Italy, with Gold in XC and Silver in DH. In addition to that, Tomac won two events on his way to the UCI XC World Cup title, and added a second NORBA DH title to his 1989 win. The following year, he finished in fifth place at the DH World Championship held in Bromont, Canada, and had to settle for second place behind Switzerland’s Thomas Frischknecht in the XC World Cup rankings (though there were two event wins again). An accident in which Tomac struck an errant spectator in the final event at Mount Snow, Vermont, prevented him from outscoring his rival and retaining the title.</p><p align=justify>It was 1987 when John Tomac appeared in one of the very first mountain biking instructional videos ever created, called The Great Mountain Biking Video created by New & Unique Videos of San Diego, California.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John Tomac</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tomac</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sport Cyclist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Owosso</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kathy Tomac</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Eli Tomac</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>John Tomac ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, John Tomac's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update John Tomac's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Between 1994 and 1997, Tomac would win three more NORBA titles – two in DH and one in XC – as well as some notable individual events such as the Sea Otter Classic and Cactus Cup. He officially announced his retirement from racing at the Sea Otter Classic in 2000, but would later make an occasional return to competition. In 2004, at the age of 37, he won the famous Kamikaze Downhill held at Mammoth Mountain, California. Then, for good measure, he returned in 2005 and won it again.</p><h2>John Tomac Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>John Tomac is one of the <strong>richest Sport Cyclist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>John Tomac</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>John Tomac first participated in cycling at the age of seven.&nbsp;Tomac began competing in BMX races in and around Michigan in 1975 , and continued to compete in the discipline until his teens. He raced in competition with Michigan BMX legendary riders Tony Carnes, Mike Chapman along with Tim Root.&nbsp;At the age of 16, Tomac won the National Cruiser Class title as part of Mongoose’s manufacturing Mongoose team.&nbsp;He became a professional rider in 1985, and spent his final year in BMX racing, competing in events as privateer.</p><p align=justify>The year 1986 was the time that Tomac was able to make two important decision: he moved in Southern California, and left BMX competition to focus on mountain biking.&nbsp;He continued to race for Mongoose.&nbsp;In the autumn of the year, he was the winner of the first two major mountain bike races: The Ross Fat Tire Stage Race in Massachusetts and the Supercross Mountain Bike Exhibition race which was held in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.&nbsp;Mongoose promoted the Tomac Signature Edition model in 1987, which showed the growing popularity of his brand in mountain biking circles.&nbsp;Tomac was able to score a few noteworthy wins in the year, including a victory during the Fat Tire Stage Race and three National XC Series rounds.</p><p align=justify>1988 brought Tomac national title-winning success. By achieving the highest combined points total from the National Off-Road Bicycle Association’s (NORBA) Cross-country, Downhill and Dual Slalom championships, Tomac won the overall title of NORBA World Champion. He was ranked in first place in the Cross-country and Dual Slalom disciplines. The “World” status was a misnomer, however, as the NORBA championships were held only in the United States. The first true World Championships for XC and DH, sanctioned by the Union Cycliste Internationale, were held in Durango, Colorado, in 1990 where John placed 4th in the downhill. John is well remembered for riding road style drop bars on his Yeti mountain bike at this race which was a noticeable deviation from the other riders. This equipment decision was influenced by his recent experience riding for the 7-11 road cycling team in Europe where he was under contract. Tomac’s results and rapid rise to prominence earned recognition from U.S. cycling magazine Velo News, which voted him the world’s best all-round rider of 1988.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sport Cyclist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In January 1998, John Tomac entered into a business partnership with Manitou founder and suspension engineer Doug Bradbury, whom Tomac had known since the 1980s. Together, they founded Tomac Bicycles, and launched a range of three full suspension bikes later that year. Tomac spent the 1998 season competing on his new prototype design in DH events.</p><p>The brand name was later acquired by American Bicycle Group, which in turn sold it to Joel Smith, formerly a brand manager at Answer Products, in June 2006. He relocated the company to Nebraska and set in place plans to relaunch the Tomac brand with a new model range in 2007. Tomac remains actively involved in the company and the design of its products.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>John Tomac height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> John <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1993, Tomac was the runner-up to Germany’s Jürgen Beneke in the inaugural UCI Downhill World Cup and lost out to Frischknecht again in the XC rankings.
