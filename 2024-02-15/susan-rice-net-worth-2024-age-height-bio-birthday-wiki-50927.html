The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: “I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come down on the side of dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required.” Later in 2012, during an interview with The New Republic, Rice stated “To suggest that I’m repenting for [Rwanda] or that I’m haunted by that or that I don’t sleep at night because of that or that every policy I’ve implemented subsequently is driven by that is garbage.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Susan Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Politician</strong>.
