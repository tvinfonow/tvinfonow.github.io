Leon cast Joshua Jackson as the male lead but had not cast the female lead role. By then, Ridloff had been tutoring Leon for over a year. He asked her to substitute at a read-through early on, and based on her performance, he offered her the role. The cast had an initial run at the Berkshire Theatre Group in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. One of the most challenging aspects of her role was using her voice, which she had not used since she was 13 years old. The New York Times wrote, “Ms. Ridloff compares the experience of using her voice during the play to a crotch shot, saying that at first she felt exposed, and vulnerable, and ugly.” After a year with the role and with a vocal coach, she found greater ease. She explained, “It feels empowering to me—like finally I own every part of myself, [but] I don’t see myself ever using my voice on a conversational level—that’s just not who I am.” The revival premiered on Broadway in April 2018, and The New York Times wrote, “Critics were underwhelmed by the production, but mesmerized by Ms. Ridloff.” The revival was shuttered on May 27, 2018.</p><h2>Lauren Ridloff Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Lauren Ridloff is one of the <strong>richest Tv Actress</strong> from United States.
