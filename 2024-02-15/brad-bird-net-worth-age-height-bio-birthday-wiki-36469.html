His father worked in the propane business, and his grandfather, Francis Wesley “Frank” Bird, who was born in County Sligo, Ireland, was a president and chief executive of the Montana Power Company. On a tour of the Walt Disney Studios at age&nbsp;11, he met Frank Thomas & Ollie Johnston and announced that someday he would become part of Disney’s animation team.

By age&nbsp;14, barely in high school, Bird was mentored by the animator Milt Kahl, one of Disney’s Nine Old Men.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Brad Bird</b>'s net worth <strong>$40 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He created his first animated film at the age of 13 after getting inspired by a trip the&nbsp;He made his first animation film at age 13 after being inspired by a visit to <a href=#>Walt Disney</a> Studios.&nbsp;Studios.</p><p align=justify>He was the director of Ratatouille which was awarded the Academy Award in 2008 for the Best Animated Film.</p><p align=justify>Before he was sidetracked by Ratatouille, Bird began work on a film adaptation of James Dalessandro’s novel 1906, which would be his first live-action project. In March 2008, Bird resumed work on the film, which is a co-production between Pixar and Warner Bros. The novel, narrated by reporter Annalisa Passarelli, examines police officers battling corruption in the government that causes the 1906 San Francisco earthquake to turn into such a disaster. The script was co-written by John Logan. Blogger Jim Hill suggested the film has been on hold due to Disney / Pixar and Warner Bros.’ nervousness over the projected $200&nbsp;million budget. In May 2010, with 1906 apparently still stalled, Bird signed on as the director of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, produced by Tom Cruise and J. J. Abrams. The collaboration was suggested by Tom Cruise following the release of The Incredibles, and was created with the help of J.J. Abrams, who sent Bird a late night text message saying “Mission?”. The film was an international hit, grossing almost $700 million.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>He next worked on animated television series, with much shorter lead times. He was the creator (writer, director, and co-producer) of the Family Dog episode of Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories. In addition, Bird co-wrote the screenplay for the live-action film Batteries Not Included. In 1989, Bird joined Klasky Csupo, where he helped to develop The Simpsons from one-minute shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show into a series of half-hour programs. In 1990, he directed the episode “Krusty Gets Busted” (which marked the first speaking role of Sideshow Bob) and co-directed the Season Three episode “Like Father, Like Clown.” He served as an executive consultant for the show for its first eight seasons. Also while at Klasky Csupo, he was one of the animators of the Rugrats pilot “Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing.” He worked on several other animated television series, including The Critic and King of the Hill, before pitching Warner Brothers to write and direct the animated film The Iron Giant. Despite receiving near-universal acclaim from critics, it failed at the box office due to lack of marketing and promotion from Warner Bros. He was then hired by Steve Jobs who wanted him to work for Pixar. Bird pitched the idea for The Incredibles to Pixar. In the finished picture, Bird also provides the voice of costume designer Edna Mode. As an inside joke, the character Syndrome was based on Bird’s likeness (as was Mr. Incredible) and according to him, he did not realize the joke until the movie was too far into production to have it changed. The film, written and directed by Bird, was released in 2004 to major critical and financial success. As a result, Bird won his first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and his screenplay was nominated for Best Original Screenplay.</p><p>In 1998, during production of The Iron Giant, Bird’s older sister, Susan, was shot and killed by her estranged husband in a murder-suicide. While coping with the tragedy, Bird decided to adjust the story of the film to include a message of anti-gun violence, and dedicated the film to her.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Brad Bird height</b> Not available right now.

He worked as an animator on The Small One (1978), The Fox and the Hound (1981), The Black Cauldron (1985) albeit uncredited. While animating at Disney, he became a part of a small group of animators who worked in a suite of offices inside the original animation studio called the “Rat’s Nest”, which was pejoratively dubbed by animator Don Bluth during production of The Small One. There, he would vocally criticize the upper management for not taking risks on animation and playing it safe. During the middle of production of The Fox and the Hound, Bird was fired by animation administrator Ed Hansen.</p><p align=justify>In the middle of 2005, Bird was asked by the Pixar management team to write and direct Ratatouille, which Jan Pinkava had been in charge of at the time. This change was announced in March 2006 during a Disney shareholders meeting. The film was released in 2007, and was another critical and box office success for Bird. Ratatouille won the Best Animated Feature award at the 2008 Golden Globes; it was also nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature and Best Original Screenplay. On February 24, 2008, Ratatouille won Bird his second Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.</p><h2>Who is Brad Bird Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Brad Bird</strong> married to <strong>Elizabeth Canney </strong>.
