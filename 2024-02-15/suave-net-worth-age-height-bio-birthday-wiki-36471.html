According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Suave</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Born Waymond Anderson, he was discovered at a New Edition concert in California in the mid-1980s when one of the members asked him to come up on stage and sing with them. After his initial nervousness on stage, he decided this was the career route he wanted to take. A few years later, in 1988, Suave released his first single, “My Girl,” as well as an album, I’m Your Playmate. The single rose to #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #22 on the Radio & Records Pop Chart. Later in the year, he released a single called “Shake Your Body,” which climbed to #22 on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Today, Suave’s songs are not commonly heard on U.S. radio.</p><p align=justify>Waymond Anderson was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for arson murder in the torching of a crack house near the USC campus which proved fatal to a drug addict. During his years in the music business he admitted to being a drug dealer as well as an adulterer. He also perjured himself in court by recanting an implication of police officer involvement in the death of Christopher Wallace. Today Suave is still in prison although new information has been presented that he was in Jackson, Mississippi, visiting his sister the day of the alleged murder. Even a minister in Jackson states he saw Anderson at his church the day of the murder. All witnesses who once testified against him have come forward with their own stories why they implicated Anderson as a killer; however both have changed their stories, alleging the police placed them under duress. Anderson is hoping to one day be found innocent of these charges he claims are false. His son, 6 at the time of the crime, recently graduated high school. He also has a wife. August 1, 2008, Suge Knight was formally accused of sending death threats to Waymond “Suave” Anderson to change his testimony regarding the 1997 death of The Notorious B.I.G. in court July 31, 2008.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Suave height</b> Not available right now.
