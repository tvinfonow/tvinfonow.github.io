He was hired to be part of the staff band for the popular Louisiana Hayride radio show in Shreveport. While he was still a teenager, Burton left Shreveport for Los Angeles, where he joined Ricky Nelson’s band. There, he made numerous recordings as a session musician. Burton created and played the guitar solo on Dale Hawkins 1957 hit song “Susie Q”, a record that would become one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.</p><h2>Burton Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Burton is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Burton</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Burton was born in Dubberly in south Webster Parish near Minden, Louisiana, to Guy M. Burton (1909–2001) and the former Lola Poland (1914–2011), a native of rural Fryeburg in Bienville Parish. She was the daughter of James and Althius Poland.

He has used a Music Man 210-150, an old Fender Twin with K model Lansing speakers, and a 1964 Fender Deluxe. His primary guitar has always been a Fender Telecaster, beginning with an early blonde model his parents bought for him around 1952. His 1969 Paisley Red (better known as Pink Paisley) Telecaster became the basis for his James Burton Telecaster model in 1991, with Lace Sensor pickups and a TBX tone circuit. Five years later his 1953 Candy Apple Red Telecaster was the inspiration for a standard version Artist Signature model featuring two Fender Texas Special Tele single coil pickups and a vintage-style 6-saddle bridge. In 2006, the Signature Paisley model was redesigned with a red paisley flame design over a black body, plus three specially designed blade pickups, a no-load tone control and S-1 switching system.</p><p>The Shindig! exposure led to recording session work with a variety of artists, mostly as an unattributed sideman. In 1967 Burton played Dobro on the Richie Furay song, “A Child’s Claim To Fame” on Buffalo Springfield’s second album, Buffalo Springfield Again. Due to the volume of work, Burton turned down an offer to join Bob Dylan’s first touring band, and another offer to play on Elvis Presley’s 1968 comeback TV special Elvis.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Burton height</b> Not available right now.

In 1965 he started working on the television program Shindig! which curtailed his touring with Nelson. However, Burton continued contributing to his friend’s studio albums through the Perspective sessions in April 1968.</p><p align=justify>During 1975 and 1976, while still touring with Presley, Burton was one of the first members to join and tour with Emmylou Harris as part of her backing band, the “Hot Band”, after the death of Gram Parsons. He was joined by a cast of talented musicians which included his bandmate with Presley, Glen D. Hardin, and newer musicians which included Rodney Crowell. However, once Presley was ready to return to the road, Burton returned to perform with him, although the others, including Hardin, elected to continue with Harris. Just before Presley died in 1977, Burton was called to play on a John Denver television special. During the taping, Denver asked if Burton would consider going on a European tour. Burton said he was working with Elvis, but if scheduling permitted, he would be glad to go. Shortly after Elvis’ death, Burton began a regular collaboration with Denver. The first album they recorded was I Want to Live.</p><h2>Who is Burton Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Burton</strong> married to <strong>Louise Burton</strong>.

Burton organized the TCB Band, serving as its leader, and backed Presley from 1969 until Presley’s death in 1977. A hallmark of Elvis’ live shows during this period was his exhortation, “Play it, James,” as a cue for the guitarist’s solos. For the first season in Vegas in 1969, Burton played his red standard Telecaster. Shortly thereafter, he purchased the now familiar pink paisley custom Telecaster. Burton was not sure that Elvis would like it; however, since Elvis did, Burton used it for every show.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Russell Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.
