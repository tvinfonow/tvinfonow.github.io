College football Hall of Famers thought to be among the most outstanding players the game of college football had ever witnessed.&nbsp;He was never able perform professionally due to injury.&nbsp;He was a winner of two national championships at Nebraska’s University of Nebraska.</p><p>He is a part of a select group of quarterbacks who have won back-to back national championships while in college with A.J.&nbsp;McCarron, Steve Davis, and Jerry Tagge.</p><p>Frazier received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and played for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team. After several years in which the Cornhuskers had suffered blowout losses in bowl games, frequently in Orange Bowl matchups against the University of Miami Hurricanes and the Florida State Seminoles, head coach Tom Osborne changed his recruiting strategy in the early 1990s and began to recruit faster players at all positions. Osborne reportedly shed tears upon receiving the news of Frazier’s decision to accept a scholarship from Nebraska. Frazier, rated as the No. 3 college recruit in the country by analyst Tom Lemming, led Nebraska to four consecutive New Year’s Day bowl games.</p><p>Frazier played in nine games during the 1992 regular season, and completed 44 of 100 passes for 727 yards and only one interception. He rushed for 399 yards, and scored 17 touchdowns, rushing and passing. His longest run was 52 yards, against Iowa State on November 14.</p><p align=justify>He was married and had two kids along with Andrea Stephens.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tommie Frazier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tommie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Frazier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bradenton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Priscilla Frazier</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rod Frazier</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Andrea Stephens</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Tommie James Frazier III, Ava Frazier</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tommie Frazier ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He completed 13-of-19 passes for 145 yards and an 11-yard touchdown pass in a 14-13 victory over the Bruins who had the Pac-10’s top pass defense. This enabled Nebraska to achieve an undefeated record during the regular season in 1993. Frazier rushed for over 1,000 yards through the regular- and post-season, though the official total is lower due to negative yardage from sacks. He rushed for nine touchdowns, with a longest run of 58 yards, and completed 77 of 162 passes for 12 touchdowns, four interceptions and 1,159 yards in 11 games. His longest pass play of the season was a 60-yard touchdown to wingback Corey Dixon on October 30 against the Colorado Buffaloes.</p><h2>Tommie Frazier Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Tommie Frazier is one of the <strong>richest Football Player</strong> from United States.

He played well in the FedEx Orange Bowl on January 1, 1993 against an 11-1 Florida State team led by quarterback Charlie Ward, wide receiver Tamarick Vanover, and linebacker Marvin Jones. Florida State took an early 20-0 lead, but Frazier, who started the game in a shotgun formation, responded with a 41-yard touchdown pass to Corey Dixon and a red zone touchdown pass to Gerald Armstrong. The Seminoles won the game, 27-14.</p><p>Sports Illustrated’s Tim Layden, who covered Frazier in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, discussed his leadership and toughness following Nebraska’s 62-24 dismantling of the Florida Gators. “On that memorable 75-yard touchdown run, Frazier broke seven tackles and dragged two Florida defenders several yards before shaking free and rolling down the sideline alone,” Layden elaborated. “And after playing brilliantly in both Nebraska’s 18-16 Orange Bowl loss to Florida State in 1994 and the Cornhuskers’ 24-17 national-title victory over Miami last season, he must now be considered one of the best big-game quarterbacks in college football history—it’s Tommie Fraizer.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Tommie Frazier height</b> Not available right now.

Nebraska started the season with a 4-1 record under Grant, but an early 29-14 loss to the second-ranked Washington Huskies set up Frazier’s opportunity to take over as the starting quarterback. He did so at Missouri on October 24, a 34-24 Nebraska victory. Frazier gained national recognition with the following two games, both blowout wins broadcast nationally in evening time slots on ESPN. He led the team on Halloween to a 52-7 win against a powerful Colorado team that carried a 9-1-1 record and was led by quarterback Kordell Stewart. Frazier threw sparingly, completing 4 of 12 passes for 55 yards and two touchdowns, but rushed 16 times for 86 of Nebraska’s 373 rushing yards. Frazier’s arm was showcased the following week, November 7, in a 49-7 win over Kansas. Play-action fakes resulted in long touchdown passes of 36 and 46 yards, and Frazier finished the game with 6 of 11 passes completed, for 161 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p align=justify>The FedEx Orange Bowl game played on January 1, 1994 featured a rematch between Nebraska and Florida State. Frazier, now a sophomore, was pitted against newly crowned Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward. A last minute drive by Ward led to a Seminoles field goal that prevented the Cornhuskers from winning the national title. Frazier’s 29-yard pass to split end Trumaine Bell positioned Nebraska for a potentially game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt with 0:01 left on the game clock, but the kick sailed wide left, and Florida State won 18-16. Frazier was named Most Valuable Player of the national title game despite the loss, completing 13 of 24 passes for 206 yards and a 34-yard touchdown, and rushing 14 times for 77 yards with a 32-yard run. The Cornhuskers finished the season with an 11-1 record.</p><h2>Who is Tommie Frazier Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Tommie Frazier</strong> married to <strong>Andrea Stephens</strong>.
