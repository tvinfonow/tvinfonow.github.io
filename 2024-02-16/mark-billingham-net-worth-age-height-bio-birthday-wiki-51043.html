Bread & Circuses toured with a number of shows in schools, colleges, arts centres and the street. In the mid-1980s he moved from Birmingham to London as a “jobbing actor”, taking minor roles in episodes of TV shows Dempsey and Makepeace, Juliet Bravo, Boon, and The Bill. After finding himself playing a variety of “bad guy roles such as a soccer hooligan, drug addict, a nasty copper, a racist copper or a bent copper”, he became somewhat disenchanted with acting, perceiving that the emphasis was not on talent, but on looks.</p><p>Around 1987 he decided to pursue a career in comedy, in part because:</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mark Billingham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sabina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chantouria</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Novelist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 2</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Claire Winyard</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Katie Billingham</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mark Billingham ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He was the human face on the puppet-representation-of-celebrities series Spitting Image, and “the taller half” of top double act the “Tracy Brothers” with Mike Mole from Bread & Circuses days (now guitarist with British comedy punk band Punks Not Dad), appearing regularly on the radio version of The Mary Whitehouse Experience. In 1988, he was seen in the children’s comedy series News at Twelve, in which the central character “broadcasts his own (imaginary) TV news bulletin every evening”.</p><p align=justify>Sleepyhead was released in August 2001, and made it onto the Sunday Times “Top Ten Bestseller” list, becoming “the biggest selling debut novel of that Summer”.

You may help us to build the dating records for Mark Billingham!<p>On the heels of 2001’s Sleepyhead and 2002’s Scaredy Cat, Thorne returned in 2003’s Lazybones, investigating the killing of a convicted rapist, and finding it difficult to become involved in the case, since he has little real sympathy for the victim. A messy contract killer and the past cases of a former colleague blur together in The Burning Girl as the past meets the present in a symphony of violence. Thorne’s involvement in a previous case affects his ability to investigate an increasing death toll among the homeless of London in Lifeless, while a kidnapping case forms the backbone of 2006’s Buried. Death Message, the Thorne novel published in August 2007 sees him haunted by a psychopath he has already put behind bars, but who is reaching out from prison to manipulate the world outside. After resting Thorne for the standalone thriller In The Dark (although he does appear in a very minor role), Billingham returned to his perennial character in 2009 with Bloodline, in the 2010 novel From The Dead and in 2011 with “Good As Dead”. After a break for a second standalone thriller, “Rush Of Blood”, Thorne returned in 2013 in “The Dying Hours”. Five more Thorne novels have since been published.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Sabina Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Novelist</strong>.

Mark Billingham celebrates birthday on July 2 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Billingham created Detective Inspector Tom Thorne for his 2001 debut novel Sleepyhead, where a case of “Locked-In syndrome” reveals the dark depths of a twisted mind, as adept at toying with the DI as with the victims. This central character has since featured in the vast majority of his works, except In the Dark, released in August 2008, Rush of Blood, released in August, 2012, and Die of Shame (May 2016) in which Thorne has only very minor roles. The author writes that, “if writers want their readers to care about a character, they have to care themselves” and, as such, has imbued Thorne with a lot of his personal characteristics. The two share a birthday, a locale (London) and musical interests (a “love of country music both alt and cheesy” – although Billingham implies that it is Thorne’s fictional musical tastes that have grown on the author).</p><h3>Do you need to read Mark Billingham books in order?</h3><p>Not a big deal if you do, but for the sake of continuity, <b>you might want to read the Mark Billingham books in chronological order</b>.</p><h3>What did Mark Billingham get MBE for?</h3><p>In his time with the elite unit he received an MBE for <b>leading the mission in Iraq to rescue a British hostage</b>.
