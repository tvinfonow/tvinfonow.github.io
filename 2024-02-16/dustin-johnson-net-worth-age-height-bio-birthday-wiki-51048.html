He finished in a tie for second place at Royal St Georgeâ€™s, alongside fellow American Phil Mickelson, three strokes behind champion Darren Clarke. Johnsonâ€™s first three rounds of 70-68-68 left him one stroke behind Clarke and for most of Sundayâ€™s round Johnson managed to keep up with him, at one stage being just one back. His final round charge was derailed at the par five 14th, when his second shot went out of bounds and led to a double bogey. This took Johnson out of contention as he slipped to four strokes behind Clarke with only four holes to play. One highlight of Johnsonâ€™s week at Royal St Georgeâ€™s came in the first round when he recorded a hole in one on the par three 16th hole. This result marked the third time that Johnson had been part of the final group on Sunday at a major championship and also occurring in three out of the four majors, the 2010 U.S. Open, the 2010 PGA Championship and the 2011 Open Championship. As a result of this second-place finish, Johnson moved to his highest spot in the Official World Golf Ranking at the time, seventh, and became the third-ranked American behind Steve Stricker and Mickelson.</p><h3>How much did Dustin Johnson win today in the golf tournament?</h3><p>LIV Golf Boston Final Prize Money, Payouts: Dustin Johnson Wins Playoff, <b>$4 Million</b>.</p><h3>Is Dustin Johnson Rich?</h3><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <b>Johnson has an estimated net worth of $50 million</b>.
