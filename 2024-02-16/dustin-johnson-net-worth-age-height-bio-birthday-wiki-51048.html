He finished in a tie for second place at Royal St George’s, alongside fellow American Phil Mickelson, three strokes behind champion Darren Clarke. Johnson’s first three rounds of 70-68-68 left him one stroke behind Clarke and for most of Sunday’s round Johnson managed to keep up with him, at one stage being just one back. His final round charge was derailed at the par five 14th, when his second shot went out of bounds and led to a double bogey. This took Johnson out of contention as he slipped to four strokes behind Clarke with only four holes to play. One highlight of Johnson’s week at Royal St George’s came in the first round when he recorded a hole in one on the par three 16th hole. This result marked the third time that Johnson had been part of the final group on Sunday at a major championship and also occurring in three out of the four majors, the 2010 U.S. Open, the 2010 PGA Championship and the 2011 Open Championship.
