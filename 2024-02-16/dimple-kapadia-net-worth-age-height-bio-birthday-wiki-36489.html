Glamorous Bollywood actress who gained fame in the 1980s and the ’90s for her performances in Kaash Rudaali, Kaash Krantiveer.</p><p>In the decade 2000 she was a supporting character in films that were lauded, such as Dabangg where she was Naini Pa. Pandey in the film alongside leading man&nbsp;In the 2000s, she played supporting roles in acclaimed films like Dabangg, where she played Naini P. Pandey alongside the film’s star <a href=#>Salman Khan</a>..</p><p>Dimple Kapadia (born 8 June 1957) is an Indian actress who predominantly appears in Hindi films. She was discovered at age 16 by Raj Kapoor, who cast her in the title role of his teen romance Bobby (1973), to critical and commercial success. In that same year, she married Indian actor Rajesh Khanna and retired from acting. Kapadia returned to films in 1984, two years after her separation from Khanna. Her comeback film Saagar was released a year later, and gained her wide public recognition. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress twice for Bobby and Saagar. She went on to establish herself as one of the leading actresses of Hindi cinema in the 1980s.</p><p>Kapadia, who called herself “film crazy”, aspired to be an actress even as a child. An opportunity arose in 1971 when Raj Kapoor was looking for a young, new actress to play the lead in his planned teen romance, and Munni Dhawan, a close friend of Kapoor’s suggested that he consider Kapadia, having been acquainted with her father. Aged 14, she performed a screen test for the film in June that year on the sets of one of Kapoor’s productions, and was cast in the part. The film was named Bobby and released in September 1973, by which time Kapadia was already married. It starred Kapoor’s son Rishi Kapoor in his first leading role as Raj Nath, the son of a wealthy Hindu businessman, and Kapadia was given the title role of Bobby Braganza, the teenaged daughter of a working-class Christian fisherman from Goa. The story follows the love affair between Raj and Bobby in the face of his parents’ disapproval of their relationship. Bobby was a major mainstream and critical success, and Kapadia was lauded for her performance, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (tied with Jaya Bhaduri for Abhimaan). Qurratulain Hyder of The Illustrated Weekly of India noted that she acted with “natural ease and freshness”. In later years Kapadia would credit Raj Kapoor for her development as an actress: “the sum total of me today as an actress, whatever I am, is Raj Kapoor.” Several of her lines in the film became popular, particularly, “Mujhse dosti karoge?” (“Will you be my friend?”), and the “miniskirts, midriff-baring polka dot shirts, and fabled red bikini” she wore made her a youth fashion icon of the times in India. Consequently polka-dotted dresses were often referred to as ‘Bobby Print’. Bhawana Somaaya of The Hindu credits Kapadia with starting film memorabilia merchandising in the country, and Mukesh Khosla of The Tribune reported that Bobby established her as a “cult figure” as she led the fashion trends. In 2008, Rediff.com ranked her performance in the film as the fourth-best female debut of all-time in Hindi cinema: “An elfin little girl with big, lovely eyes, nobody quite portrayed innocence as memorably as Dimple in her first outing. She was candid, striking, and a true natural&nbsp;… here was a girl who would redefine glamour and grace, and make it look very, very easy indeed.” She left the film industry to raise her children.</p><p align=justify>She was married to the legendary Bollywood actress&nbsp;She married legendary Bollywood actor <a href=#>Rajesh Khanna</a>, but the two divorced in 1984.

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>After Kapadia’s separation from Khanna in 1982, she was keen on returning to acting, which she did in 1984. For the next decade, she would go on to become one of the leading actresses in Hindi cinema. Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities. The first film she worked on was Saagar, directed by Ramesh Sippy, after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting. She first performed a screen test, which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and “literally shivering” while making it. To her surprise, Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the lead part opposite her Bobby co-star Rishi Kapoor. Scripted with her in mind, the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle, but its one-year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before, the first of which was Zakhmi Sher (1984). Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia, including one in which she was seen topless for a split second. The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India’s official entry to the Oscars that year. Kapadia’s performance as Mona D’Silva, a young Catholic woman from Goa who is torn between her friend (Kamal Haasan) and the man she loves (Kapoor), won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards. A review by Asiaweek labelled her “a delight”. Rediff.com noted, “Dimple, caught between a friend and lover, performed solidly and memorably, grounding the two male leads and making the film work.” A 1993 issue of India Today wrote, “Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty. She looked ravishing: auburn hair, classical face, deep eyes, an aura of sensuality. It was clear she was back.”</p><h2>Dimple Kapadia Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Dimple Kapadia is one of the <strong>richest Movie Actress</strong> from India.

Chunibhai was from a wealthy Ismaili Khoja family, whose members had reportedly “embraced Hinduism” without relinquishing Ismaili loyalties; Bitti was an Ismaili, too, and the couple followed Aga Khan as a religious mentor. When barely a month old, Dimple was given the name Ameena (literally, “honest” or “trustworthy” in Arabic) by Aga Khan III, although she was never referred to by it. She is the eldest of four children; her siblings—all of whom have died—are sisters Simple (also an actress) and Reem, and a brother, Suhail.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Movie Actress</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Kapadia separated from Khanna in April 1982, moving with her two daughters back to her parents’ house. She returned to acting two years later. In a 1985 interview with India Today, she remarked, “The life and happiness in our house came to an end the day I and Rajesh got married,” sharing her unhappy marital experience and calling their marriage “a farce”. According to journalist Dinesh Raheja, the hostility between Khanna and Kapadia had faded over the years, and in spite of not having ever reunited, they were seen together at parties, she worked in his self-produced film Jai Shiv Shankar (1990) and even campaigned for his election. In a later interview after Khanna’s death, she reflected back positively on her marriage, referring to it as her “biggest high”. Asked in Filmfare whether she would want to remarry, Kapadia replied, “I’m very happy and content … Once was more than enough.” She was reported to be in a relationship with Sunny Deol after they starred together in several films in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Her daughters also became actresses and retired after settling down. Her elder daughter, Twinkle, is married to actor Akshay Kumar.</p><p>Films featuring Kapadia that came out before Saagar included Manzil Manzil in 1984, as well as Aitbaar and Arjun in 1985. She had a role opposite Sunny Deol in Manzil Manzil, a drama directed by Nasir Hussain. While speaking of her positive experience during the making of the film, she expressed her lack of comfort performing the “routine song-and-dance” nature of the part. Mukul Anand’s Aitbaar was a Hitchcockian thriller for which she received positive reviews. She starred as Neha, a wealthy young woman whose greedy husband (played by Raj Babbar) plots to murder her. Speaking of her performance, she said that during shooting she was “a bag of nerves”, which eventually ended up benefitting her performance as her own state coincided with her character’s inner turmoil. She was paired up with Sunny Deol for a second time in Arjun, an action film directed by Rahul Rawail and scripted by Javed Akhtar. It was her first commercial success since her return to films.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Dimple Kapadia height</b> Not available right now.

She described herself as having been a precocious child, often making older friends, and, due to her father’s wealth and social status, enjoyed a privileged upbringing. She was 15 years old when she married actor Rajesh Khanna, then aged 30. The wedding, performed according to Arya Samaj rites, took place on 27 March 1973 in her father’s bungalow in Juhu—six months before the release of her first film, Bobby. She retired from acting for eleven years to raise her two daughters, Twinkle (born 1974) and Rinke (born 1977). Reportedly, it was Khanna who disapproved of her acting career following the marriage, though Kapadia once noted that “career has always been secondary” to her.</p><p align=justify>When Kapadia made her comeback to movies, she faced constant comparison to her Bobby days. According to Jyotika Virdi, author of the book The Cinematic Imagination, Kapadia’s trajectory is different from that of other female Hindi film stars, and she “turned every disadvantage to her advantage”. Virdi mentioned Kapadia’s forthright manner as having a major contribution to her career: “Speaking candidly to the press, she and the reporters plotted her life’s narrative from the innocent teenager snared into an impossible marriage to the emergence of a mature ‘woman with experience.'” Kapadia is known for her assertive and moody nature; during the making of Janbaaz (1986), director Feroz Khan remarked he had never met a woman with her levels of “pent-up aggression”. Journalist Bhawana Somaaya, who conducted a series of interviews with her during the 1980s, stated: “She’s a strange bundle of contradictions. Her moods change in a jiffy.” According to some critics, this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities as “her unpredictable nature and moods have distanced many well wishers”. In reply to this, she said: “I am moody by nature. But I have never consciously hurt anyone.”</p><h2>Who is Dimple Kapadia Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Dimple Kapadia</strong> married to <strong>Rajesh Khanna </strong>.

Author Dinesh Raheja believed that Kapadia’s involvement in art films happened at a time when she was no longer willing to play the “pretty prop in hero-oriented films”, arguing that her new choices “honed Dimple’s talent for lending fine striations to complex emotions”. Speaking of the same, Mahesh Bhatt commended her for not turning into “a victim of her own success” by refusing to appear in films of strictly commercial value, namely “the money-making machine” in his words. According to Drishti (1990) director Govind Nihalani, Kapadia has a genuine interest in serious work that would challenge her talent and realise her potential. Similar sentiments were shared by Shashi Kapoor, who said she had always been eager to act in quality films. She said her interest in independent films was a conscious decision to experiment in different cinema and prove her abilities. She normally never seeks advice before committing to a project, which she admits has sometimes cultivated in wrong choices. She often willingly chooses to work with first-time directors, finding their enthusiasm and dedication beneficial to both the film and her performance.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Dimple Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Movie Actress</strong>.

The film became known for its love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor, in which the two also shared a full on kiss, something Hindi movie-goers were not accustomed to in those days. A review in Bombay: The City Magazine liked the film’s “slickness” but dismissed the overall product as “passé”; Kapadia’s role as Reshma was called “the macho man’s woman”, but she was noted for having played it “gamely”. In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co-star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, Vikram, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature. She played the minor part of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls for the title character, played by Haasan. At that time, she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from South India, including Pataal Bhairavi, which she detested. She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period, noting, “I shudder even now when I think of those films.
