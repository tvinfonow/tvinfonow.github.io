Canadian Soul and R&B singer who earned wide critical acclaim on his first album, Praise Break in the year 2014.&nbsp;The most well-known songs are “Get You,” “Violet” and “Japanese Denim.”</p><p>His song “Get You” features singer&nbsp;His song “Get You” features singer <a href=#>Kali Uchis</a>..</p><p>Ashton D. Simmonds (born April 5, 1995), known professionally as Daniel Caesar, is a Canadian singer and songwriter. After independently building a following through the release of two critically acclaimed EPs Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim’s Paradise (2015), Caesar released his debut album Freudian in August 2017, which also garnered widespread critical acclaim.</p><p>To [Caesar], he may see a case of his friend [Goddard], who has always been nice to him, making an honest mistake. To the larger social sphere that she regularly engages, though, [Goddard] is a habitual line stepper, who uses her problematic actions to provoke reactions then hides behind a facade of victimhood — the very thing that Caesar accuses Black fans of doing. The “jokes” he says that we can’t take, individually, don’t seem to be a problem, but they minimize any issue we may have and accusing us of sensitivity undermines us when we do speak up.</p><p align=justify>It is his real name Ashton Simmonds.&nbsp;The birthplace of his father was Oshawa, Canada and later relocated from there to Toronto, Canada.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel Caesar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Caesar</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soul Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1995</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scarborough</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ontario</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Canada</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Hollace Simmonds, Norwill Simmonds</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Daniel Caesar ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

His body of work is influenced by religion, which played a large role in his upbringing, as well as unrequited love.</p><p align=justify>Caesar is a singer-songwriter raised on the sounds of soul and gospel. His music draws from the experiences of his childhood and supplements them with a modern interpretation of R&B and electronics while lyrics explore subjects of religion and unrequited love. His singing voice reshapes itself on each track, often veering into a hushed, introspective lilting style. According to Caesar, “In my religious surroundings growing up, the point is to be still, to direct as little attention to yourself as possible and instead, direct all attention to what you’re saying. Now, it’s kind of the opposite.” Caesar cites Frank Ocean, Kanye West and Beyoncé and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison as sources of musical and aesthetic inspiration.</p><h2>Who is Daniel Caesar Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Daniel Caesar</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

You may help us to build the dating records for Daniel Caesar!<p>On March 19, 2019, Caesar posted a video, in which he repeatedly confesses to be drunk, to defend his friend, Julieanna ‘YesJulz’ Goddard via an Instagram live stream. Goddard has been called a ‘culture vulture’ for her use of Black culture and subsequent disregard for African Americans, especially black women. Goddard was specifically called out for her recent freestyle in which she implies black people take and do not give back and murder other black people. Caesar came to her defense asking why some black people were “being so mean” specifically Goddard, saying it was not “a quality.” His comments were received negatively as while Goddard claimed the lyrics were about corporations, she also has a rocky history with race relations. His video stemmed from an interaction with Dave Chappelle on John Mayer’s Instagram Live stream where Caesar thought he was being too sensitive when Chappelle called his singing ‘very gay’. He then extrapolated that black people en masse, and specifically call out culture, were overly sensitive.</p><h2>Top Facts about Daniel Caesar</h2><li>Daniel Caesar is a Canadian R&B singer-songwriter.</li><li>He was born on April 5, 1995 in Oshawa, Ontario.</li><li>His real name is Ashton Simmonds.</li><li>Caesar’s debut album “Freudian” was released in 2017.</li><li>The album earned him two Grammy nominations in 2018.</li><li>He has collaborated with artists such as H.E.R., Kali Uchis and Chance the Rapper.</li><li>Caesar won the Juno Award for Breakthrough Artist of the Year in 2018.</li><li>His music has been described as soulful and introspective.</li><li>Caesar cites gospel music as one of his biggest influences.</li><li>He has over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify as of August 2021</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Daniel Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Soul Singer</strong>.
