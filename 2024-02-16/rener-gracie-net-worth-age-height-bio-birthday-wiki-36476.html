Ryron and Rener’s video analysis of a match between Fabrício Werdum and Fedor Emelianenko was one of YouTube’s top viewed videos on June 28, 2010 with over 100,000 views in 24 hours. Gracie breakdowns are now featured on UFC’s weekly show ‘UFC Ultimate Insider.</p><p>Rener is best known for his abilities as a Gracie jiu-jitsu instructor and his role in popularizing jiu-jitsu using web-based distance learning programs. He started teaching Gracie jiu-jitsu when he was 13 years old and six years later assumed head instructor duty at the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy with his brother, Ryron. He and his brother oversaw all aspects of training and program development within an enterprise consisting of resident training at the World Headquarters in Torrance, California along with an additional location in Beverly Hills, California, which opened its doors on June 4, 2012. They also have a global network of Certified Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Training Centers, extension training through the web-based Gracie University and DVDs, and on-site training for law enforcement and military personnel. The brothers completely revamped pre-existing Gracie Academy programs developed by their father and created several new ones to facilitate the export of their instruction through distance education and cadre training. In 2017, they moved to a larger facility in Torrance to accommodate the worldwide expansion of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and rebranded as “Gracie University” to reflect the shift from a single academy to a global organization.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Rener Gracie height</b> <strong>6 ft 4 in</strong> Rener <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 4 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The creation of Gracie University, an interactive martial arts instructional website designed for distance learning, is the brothers’ most significant accomplishment as instructors and the backbone of the distance education division of the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy. Gracie University had over 60,000 students from 196 countries registered for instruction through the website within three years of its launch in 2008. As of 2011, the Gracie University offers online instruction for all of its courses. Some jiu-jitsu practitioners have criticized the University for awarding belts through online instruction believing that a physical test is the only valid assessment of a student’s ability. The brothers acknowledge that hands-on instruction is superior to distance learning, but believe that the rigor and fidelity of their video evaluation system sustain a sufficiently high standard to justify the program – especially for students who lack access to resident instruction. Furthermore, a blue belt awarded by video evaluation is called “technical blue belt” (which is white, with a blue stripe running the full length of the belt) indicating that the student has mastered the required techniques. An “official” Gracie Jiu-Jitsu blue belt and all higher belts can only be awarded by a Gracie Jiu-Jitsu certified instructor following an extended, in-person evaluation of the student. In 2017, the brothers moved to a larger facility and renamed the school Gracie University to reflect the global expansion through online training and proliferation of Certified Training Centers.</p><p align=justify>Rener married his longtime partner, Eve Torres, in Santa Barbara, California, on April 13, 2014.
