This designer is best known for his creation of Magic: The Gathering, but he also created such card and board games like Vampire: The Eternal Struggle, RoboRally, and Vampire: The Eternal Struggle.</p><p><a href=#>Mark Rosewater</a> joined him on the Magic: The Gathering design team.&nbsp;joined him as part of the Magic: The Gathering design group.</p><p>Garfield built on older prototypes of games that dated back to at least 1982, when he had created a Cosmic Encounter-inspired card game called “Five Magics.” Garfield thus combined ideas from two previous games to invent the first trading card game, Magic: The Gathering. At first, Garfield and Adkison called the game “Manaclash,” and worked on it in secret during Palladium’s lawsuit against Wizards, protecting the game’s intellectual property under a shell company called Garfield Games. Garfield began designing Magic as a Penn graduate student. Garfield’s playtesters were mostly fellow Penn students.</p><p>While searching for a publisher for RoboRally, which he designed in 1985, Wizards of the Coast began talking to Garfield through Mike Davis, but the game looked too expensive for a new company like Wizards to produce. Peter Adkison of Wizards of the Coast expressed interest in a fast-playing game with minimal equipment, something that would be popular at a game convention. Adkison asked Garfield to develop a game that was cheaper to produce than RoboRally, that might be more portable and even easy to carry around to conventions; Garfield did have an idea about combining baseball cards with a card game and began turning that rough idea into a complete game over the next week.</p><p align=justify>He was the son of an architect father and was born in Pennsylvania. His teenage years were spent in Oregon.&nbsp;His paternal great grandfather was United States President&nbsp;He was born in Pennsylvania to an architect father, and he spent his teenage years in Oregon.
