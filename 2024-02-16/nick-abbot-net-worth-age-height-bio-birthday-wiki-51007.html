Who is Nick Abbot dating now & how much money does Nick Abbot have?</p><h2>Nick Abbot Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Nick Abbot</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Radio Presenter</strong> who was born on <strong>August 22, 1960</strong> in <strong>United Kingdom</strong>.</p><p>Nick Abbot (born 22 August 1960) is an English radio presenter, who previously covered on the Real Radio network and currently presents The Late Show on Friday and Saturday on LBC.</p><p>In early 1987, he joined Radio Luxembourg to present an overnight music show. After hearing American talk show presenter Neil Rogers, Abbot was inspired and the show instead became a phone in. Eventually, a ‘straight to air’ format was settled upon, where calls would be taken unscreened. This format quickly became a hit with listeners. The absence of a delay system to ‘dump’ offensive language resulted in callers saying swear words just before they were cut off. It is believed that Abbot was one of the first (if not the first) to take calls straight to air, and later LBC colleague Iain Lee has often confessed that he stole some of his act from Nick (as well as Clive Bull and Tommy Boyd), perhaps hinting he got the inspiration for his “Triple M” show from Nick Abbot in addition to Boyd’s “Human Zoo” show.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nick Abbot</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daniel</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hartvig</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Radio Presenter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1960</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Nick Abbot ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>Abbot was part of the original line-up on Virgin Radio in April 1993. There he presented the weekday late night phone-in show Sunday–Thursday from 10 pm to 2 am. The programme was a mixture of music and phone-in. Not afraid to speak his mind, he often voiced his opinions about other stations and presenters, and it was this that eventually led him into trouble.</p><h2>Nick Abbot Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Nick Abbot is one of the <strong>richest Radio Presenter</strong> from United Kingdom. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Nick Abbot</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Nick Abbot was born on 22 August 1960, and was educated at George Heriot’s School, an independent school for boys in Edinburgh, and at Brunel University in Uxbridge in West London, where he gained an upper-second class degree in psychology. His professional career began as a Virgin Megastore DJ. He had previously presented student radio at Brunel University’s radio station, Radio Brunel.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Radio Presenter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Following a negative newspaper review by writer Robin Katz, Abbot’s outbursts on-air eventually led to a censure from the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Radio Authority. He also called phone-in shows on other radio stations, speaking to the phone operators, and commenting on the usually elderly callers while listening to the programmes while on hold. Usually, he failed to make it on air, but occasionally he did, including a memorable call to the Scottie McClue show. In June 1994 he was moved to the weekday 7&nbsp;– 10 pm show where he had to tone down his act, mainly taking music requests.</p><p>In January 1995, he moved back to the weekday late night show (this time from 11 pm to 2 am) where he remained until April that year when he was moved to the drivetime show (4&nbsp;– 7 pm). He was dismissed from the station in September that year, leaving Virgin Radio with a fine of £5,000 for a sexual reference about a fellow DJ, and a further £20,000 for allowing a caller graphically to describe a sexual practice.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Nick Abbot height</b> Not available right now.
