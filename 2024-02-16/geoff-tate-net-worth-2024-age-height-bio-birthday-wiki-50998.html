His wife Susan worked for Queensrÿche’s fan club since 1997, served as the band’s assistant manager since 2001, and was band manager from 2005-2012. She is also the manager for Tate’s solo career.

Then, during a later show the Rocklahoma Festival on May 26, Tate commented to an unresponsive crowd “You guys suck,” which his bandmates, as well as some fans, felt was an insult, but Tate would later defend his actions by stating in a court declaration “I was not insulting the audience. I was trying to motivate or excite them.” He finds that this was used against him in the lawsuit: “It’s just something that the other guys [in the band] and their team of people are trying to twist into a ‘Geoff doesn’t respect the fans’ type of thing.” He elaborated on that in an interview, saying: “I say that stuff all the time, you know. It’s part of being a front man, you know. You got to motivate the audience, you know. And I say things to get people motivated. I think… I say things to push people’s buttons to get them to react. It’s part of a performance. But if you’re in a lawsuit, of course, these things get taken out of context and put into a new format. I guess the objective is to make me look like I don’t care about the fans. Which is unfortunate.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Geoff Tate height</b> Not available right now.
