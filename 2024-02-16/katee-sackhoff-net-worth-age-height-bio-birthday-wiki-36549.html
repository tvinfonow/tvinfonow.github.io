Her persona led the writers to develop the character as more complex and volatile. Galactica’s executive producer Ron Moore described Sackhoff as having “magnetism”; and producer David Eick said, “We saw this whole other side that was all because of Katee: vulnerability, insecurity, desperation. We started freeing ourselves up to explore the weakness of the character, because we knew Katee could express those things without compromising the character’s strength.” Sackhoff said her performance was inspired by Linda Hamilton’s portrayal of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day: “I think that was the one character that I kind of looked to as far as body image and strength. I think I looked to her character and said, ‘OK, that’s kind of what you need to embody.’ ” Toward the end of the filming of Battlestar Galactica, Sackhoff began feeling physically weak.
