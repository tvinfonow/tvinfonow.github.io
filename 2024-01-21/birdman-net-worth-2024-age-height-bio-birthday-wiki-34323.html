For almost a month after his birth, he did not have a given name, which led to people simply calling him “Baby”, a nickname he retains to this day. Williams did not sign the birth certificate, which led to Bryan taking his mother’s surname at birth. As a child, Brooks and his family lived on top of a bar, which was owned by their father. His mother, Gladys, became ill and died in 1975 when Bryan was five years old. After their mother’s death, Birdman and his siblings Kim, Ronald and Ray were taken in by their uncle and spent two or three years in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, followed by two years in foster care upon their return to New Orleans. After their father Johnnie learned that they were in the foster home, a long legal battle took place in the mid-’70s which eventually ended with Johnnie and his wife Patricia gaining full custody and Bryan’s name changing to Bryan Williams. He then lived in the Magnolia Projects in Central City, New Orleans, where he developed a strong friendship with his step-brother Eldrick Wise. While living in the Magnolia, Williams and Wise began committing robberies and sold heroin before both getting arrested at the age of 16. At 18, both were again arrested for drug possession and sentenced to three years in Elayn Hunt Correctional Center. Williams served 18 months before he was acquitted of all charges.</p><p>Bryan Christopher Williams (born Bryan Christopher Brooks; February 15, 1969), known by his stage name Birdman (also known as Baby), is an American rapper, record executive and entrepreneur.

In 1992, Bryan came up with the idea to form their own record label, and wanted to name it “Cash Money Records”. Bryan and Slim would then travel to nightclubs all over Louisiana to see who was playing and try and recruit artists to the fledgling label. Their first signed artist was a local rapper named Kilo G, who released the label’s first ever project, a horrorcore album titled “The Sleepwalker” in 1992. Bryan and Slim continued to recruit more and more artists, and Bryan was able to convince his friend and local DJ Mannie Fresh to become Cash Money’s in-house producer. By the mid-1990s, Cash Money had grown to a popular independent label in the south, with most of their fanbase located in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. In 1995, Cash Money artist Lil’ Slim was introduced to 12-year-old Dwayne Carter at a local block party, and after hearing him rap, brought him to Baby’s attention, and soon after Carter was signed to Cash Money as the youngest artist on the label. Carter was placed into a group with another young rapper, 14-year-old Christopher Dorsey, and the two would be known as “Baby D” and “Lil Doogie”, The B.G.’z. During this time, Baby himself also began to rap as a member of the group 32 Golds, going by the name B-32. Despite their regional popularity, the label suffered many setbacks in the mid-1990s, with a number of the “first generation” of Cash Money artists leaving the label citing financial issues as the main reason. In addition to this, Kilo G, Pimp Daddy and Yella Boy were all murdered in the mid-90s. The only two artists to remain were Baby D and Lil Doogie, who renamed themselves Lil Wayne and B.G. respectively in 1997. The same year, Baby and Slim recruited two new artists, Turk and Juvenile, and the four were placed together in a new group, known as the Hot Boys. The Hot Boys soon took Cash Money to new heights, and the label was able to sign a $30 million deal with Universal Records in 1998.</p><p align=justify>Birdman has ten brothers and twelve sisters, including Ronald “Slim” Williams. Ronald is the co-founder of Cash Money Records, alongside Birdman. One of Birdman’s younger sisters, Tamara, was killed in a car accident in 2006. Due to their mother passing away at a young age, Birdman primarily raised his younger sister and referred to her as his “daughter”. Birdman also had a close relationship with his step-brother Eldrick Wise, who was killed in an unsolved murder in 1991.</p><h2>Who is Birdman Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Birdman</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
