Who is The Renegade dating now & how much money does The Renegade have?</p><h2>The Renegade Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>The Renegade</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Wrestler</strong> who was born on <strong>October 16, 1965</strong> in Marietta, Georgia, <strong>United States</strong>.</p><p>Wilson trained to wrestle under Killer Kowalski and debuted in 1992 under the ring name “Rio, Lord of the Jungle”. During his early career, Wilson wrestled for the Japanese promotion WAR.</p><p>Soon after his debut, The Renegade acquired Jimmy Hart as his manager and soon defeated several heels while utilizing mannerisms, moves and entrance music very similar to the Ultimate Warrior’s. On June 18, 1995, Renegade defeated Arn Anderson for the World Television Championship at The Great American Bash, his first and only championship. The following month at Bash at the Beach, Renegade defeated “Mr. Wonderful” Paul Orndorff to retain his title for the first time. Under a month later on Clash of the Champions XXI, Renegade again retained his title in a rematch with Orndorff. However, a few months later, the real Ultimate Warrior had appeared in several wrestling magazines and dispelled the belief that Wilson was him. As a result, Renegade’s momentum was virtually halted before he subsequently lost the World Television Title to Diamond Dallas Page on September 17 at Fall Brawl. He then went on to lose to Orndorff on an episode of Main Event preceding Halloween Havoc the next month in less than two minutes. On the November 6 episode of Nitro, after losing to Kevin Sullivan, Jimmy Hart turned on Renegade before ultimately burying him by splashing water in his face to remove his facepaint before saying “You’re not a Renegade! You’re just plain old Rick! A nobody! You’re nothing!”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>The Renegade</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Renate</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Verbaan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1965</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Marietta</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Georgia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>The Renegade ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Upon returning, Renegade’s signature facepaint and singlet were replaced with trunks and tribal armbands. After wrestling sporadically at house shows, Renegade returned on the July 1 episode of Nitro, where he teamed up with Joe Gomez and The Rock ‘n’ Roll Express in a losing effort to The Four Horsemen. After competing in the World War 3 battle royal, which was won by The Giant, Renegade formed a short-lived tag team with Joe Gomez in late 1996, though the team was not successful as they were relegated to being jobbers. After their team ended in early 1997, Renegade turned heel for the first time in his career during a match with Scotty Riggs on the March 22 episode of Saturday Night, which he lost. Renegade remained a jobber while competing sporadically on Nitro, Thunder, and Saturday Night. After a five-month hiatus, Renegade returned on the August 12 episode of Saturday Night in a losing effort to Super Caló. Renegade would remain utilized as a jobber throughout the rest of 1997 and 1998 (as well as being used for stunt double for the actual Ultimate Warrior during his 1998 WCW run) before wrestling the final match of his career on the December 7 episode of Nitro, which he lost to Wrath. He was released from WCW soon after.</p><h2>The Renegade Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>The Renegade is one of the <strong>richest Wrestler</strong> from United States.

On March 19 at Uncensored, Wilson, under the ring name The Renegade, was billed by Hogan as “the man that’s gonna bring Hulkamania into the 21st Century.”</p><h2>Who is The Renegade Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>The Renegade</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
