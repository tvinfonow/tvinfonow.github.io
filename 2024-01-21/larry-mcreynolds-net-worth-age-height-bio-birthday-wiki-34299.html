Who is Larry McReynolds dating now & how much money does Larry McReynolds have?</p><h2>Larry McReynolds Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Larry McReynolds</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Athlete</strong> who was born on <strong>January 10, 1959</strong> in Birmingham, Alabama, <strong>United States</strong>. Lawrence Joseph “Larry” McReynolds III (born January 10, 1959) is a former NASCAR crew chief and current racing analyst on Fox Sports as well as a columnist on Foxsports.com. In the past, he has served as an advisor to Petty Enterprises, and as a minority owner in Bang! Racing.</p><p>At the end of the 2000 season, McReynolds left the Richard Childress-owned No. 31 Chevrolet and ventured into the Fox Sports broadcast booth with Mike Joy and 3-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip. The three called the NASCAR Cup Series (Winston Cup 2001-2003, Nextel Cup 2004-2007, Sprint Cup 2008-2016) races for Fox NASCAR from 2001 through 2015 and also Busch Series races from 2001 and 2006. In 2015, he served as an analyst for Fox Sports 1’s live race coverage of the Xfinity Series, in addition to serving as an analyst on FS1’s NASCAR RaceDay and NASCAR RaceDay-Xfinity, the network’s pre-race shows for the Monster Energy Cup Series and Xfinity Series, and NASCAR Race Hub, its daily NASCAR news and highlight show. McReynolds, who was inducted into the Alabama Auto Racing Pioneers Hall of Fame in December 2013, was a longtime panelist on NASCAR Trackside and NASCAR Performance on Speed. In 2016, McReynolds served as an in-race analyst for Fox NASCAR’s 16th season broadcasting the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.</p><p>McReynolds was inducted into The Oceanside Rotary Club Hall of Fame in Daytona Beach, Florida in 2008. In 2009, McReynolds received the Living Legends of Auto Racing Russ Moyer Media Award. He played himself in the 2006 Will Ferrell comedy hit, Talladega Nights. McReynolds also co-hosted NASCAR Performance Show with Steve Post on Motor Racing Network (MRN) between 2004 and 2013, and co-authored the books “The Big Picture: My Life from Pit Road to the Broadcast Booth” and “How to Become a Winning Crew Chief.” He also has a son who is a race car driver, Brandon McReynolds.</p><p>McReynolds’ success and thorough approach to his profession earned him selection to the Copenhagen/Skoal All-Pro Team, an all-star “who’s who” of crew members, for five straight years (1991–1995), and the 1998 UAW GM Teamwork of Excellence award. McReynolds was the winning crew chief for the 1992 Daytona 500, with driver Davey Allison in the No. 28 Robert Yates Racing Ford Thunderbird.</p><p align=justify>McReynolds began 1991 with King Racing and driver Brett Bodine, but after the spring Atlanta race, left to become the crew chief for Robert Yates Racing and its famed #28, with driver Davey Allison. McReynolds and Allison combined to win 11 races and three pole positions between 1991 and mid-1993, establishing himself as one of the sport’s elite crew chiefs. He led Allison to a win in the 1992 Daytona 500, and the two swept the Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race (then The Winston) in 1991–92. In late 1993, McReynolds teamed with Ernie Irvan, a combination that produced seven wins between late 1993 and 1996 (Irvan missed the 1995 season due to injury). After joining Richard Childress Racing in 1997, McReynolds called the shots as seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt captured the elusive Daytona 500 victory in 1998.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Larry McReynolds</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lars</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Nilsson</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>athlete</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>January 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Birmingham</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Alabama</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Linda McReynolds</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brandon McReynolds</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Larry McReynolds ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
