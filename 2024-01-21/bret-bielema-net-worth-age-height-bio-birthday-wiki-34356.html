In his senior season, after Iowa beat Iowa State 21-7, Bielema approached Iowa State head coach Jim Walden for a post-game handshake and said “You’re a big prick. It’s been a pleasure kicking your ass the last five years” (Iowa State had never beaten Iowa during Bielema’s tenure with the team). The moment caused considerable stir, with University of Iowa officials reprimanding Bielema and sending an official letter of apology to Walden. Bielema graduated from Iowa with a bachelor’s degree in marketing.
