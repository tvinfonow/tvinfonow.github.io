He did so only after smoking marijuana. Davidson, who has suffered from Crohn’s disease since the age of 17 or 18, at the time said he “cannot function” without marijuana, adding that he would not be able to work on Saturday Night Live, and that attempts to perform without it have not been successful. He explained that “I can perform when I’m not high, but it wouldn’t be that much fun for me.” He attended St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School, then Tottenville High School before transferring to Xaverian High School in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2011. His mother still works as the school nurse at the latter. Following high school, he enrolled at St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights; after one semester Davidson dropped out to develop his career in comedy.</p><p align=justify>He was born living in Staten Island, New York with the younger sibling Casey.&nbsp;Their father, NYC firefighter Scott Davidson was killed during after the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks.&nbsp;In June of 2018 the couple got engaged&nbsp;He grew up in Staten Island, New York alongside his younger sister Casey.

His mother is of Irish ancestry; Davidson was raised Catholic. He has a younger sister named Casey. His father was a New York City firefighter who died in service during the September 11 attacks; he was last seen running up the stairs of the Marriott World Trade Center, just before it collapsed. Davidson, then seven years old, was profoundly affected by the loss. He told The New York Times that it was “overwhelming” and that he later acted out in school as a result of the trauma; at one point, he ripped his hair out until he was bald. In October 2016, Davidson revealed on The Breakfast Club morning radio show that he struggled with suicidal thoughts when he was younger, and that the music of rap artist Kid Cudi saved his life.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Comedian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Davidson joined the cast of Saturday Night Live with that show’s 40th-season premiere, which debuted on September 27, 2014. At age 20, he was the first SNL cast member to be born in the 1990s, and one of the youngest cast members ever. The first new addition to the cast that season, Davidson was given a chance to audition for the show through regular Bill Hader, whom he had met while filming a small part in the 2015 Judd Apatow feature film comedy Trainwreck. Hader subsequently told producer Lorne Michaels about him. His debut garnered positive critical notice, with his most noted skits during the season including an Indiana Jones-style sketch in which he and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, after being pelted with poison darts, were forced to mutually suck poison out of each other’s various body parts, an endeavor that eventually found them entangled in the “69” position. Another involved Davidson being shot in the chest with an arrow by Norman Reedus.</p><p>Davidson subsequently made standup appearances on television and appeared in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
