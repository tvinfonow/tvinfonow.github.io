Nothing. He didn’t care. As far as he was concerned it didn’t concern him. It wasn’t anything he needed to worry about. He certainly wasn’t going out in public to do anything about it. He admitted that many media sources had already contacted him and he was just going to ignore it until it went away. I tried to convince him that this would only get worse if he didn’t respond and that he really needed to get someone to answer calls quickly or it would be taken as an admission of guilt or suspicion. Finally he admitted he had no one to deal with interviews or media. I offered to help temporarily until he found someone.

It started with the publication of the now-discredited memoir Michelle Remembers in 1980, and culminated in the McMartin preschool trial, a heavily publicized trial which ran from 1984 to 1990, during which prosecutors, through aggressive and leading questions, managed to get over 300 of the preschool’s children to testify that they had been sexually abused by their teachers as part of Satanic rituals. The charges were all eventually dropped. Media coverage during the trial tended to side with the prosecutors, and often singled out the Church of Satan as the culprit. This led Zeena to volunteer to serve as the Church of Satan’s first spokesperson. In a September 2011 interview, Zeena recalled,</p><p align=justify>On August 8, 1988, a large gathering converged on the Strand Theater in San Francisco for the film debut of a ‘mockumentary’ about Charles Manson. The event, planned and carried out by Nikolas Schreck, was the largest single gathering of this kind in history. Zeena spoke at the beginning of the rally and a film of her baptism was played. In a 2011 interview with Zeena for French music magazine Obsküre, she stated that 8-8-88 “would be the only performance that Nikolas, Evil Wilhelm [the original Radio Werewolf percussionist], and I ever performed live together. That marked the transition point spanning three phases of Radio Werewolf: 1) the Nikolas Schreck/Evil Wilhelm collaboration, 2) the solo Nikolas Schreck phase, and 3) the Nikolas Schreck/Zeena collaboration.” Also featured were NON, Amok Press and Kris Force, a musician who at the time owned the Strand Theater. Geraldo Rivera’s “Devil Worship: Exposing Satan’s Underground” film crew filmed the event, as well as interviews with all involved, to use for the network special.</p><h2>Who is Zeena Schreck Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Zeena Schreck</strong> married to <strong>Nikolas Schreck </strong>.
