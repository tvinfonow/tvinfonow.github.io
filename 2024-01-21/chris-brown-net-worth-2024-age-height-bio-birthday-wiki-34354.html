Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to labels such as Jive Records, J-Records and Warner Bros. Records. According to Mark Pitts in an interview with HitQuarters, Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts’ reaction was: “I saw the potential … I didn’t love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn’t a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records.” Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Brown stated, “I picked Jive because they had the best success with younger artists in the pop market, […] I knew I was going to capture my African American audience, but Jive had a lot of strength in the pop area as well as longevity in careers.” Brown attended Essex High School in Virginia until early 2005, when he moved to New York to pursue his music career.</p><p>On June 13, 2006, Brown released a DVD entitled Chris Brown’s Journey, which shows footage of him traveling in England and Japan, getting ready for his first visit to the Grammy Awards, behind the scenes of his music videos and bloopers.
