In the 1980s and ’90s, he was the host of the syndicated Weekly Top 40 Countdown radio program.&nbsp;His comedy album Hurt Me Baby-Make Me Write Bad Checks earned him a Grammy nomination in 1984.</p><p>Dees resigned from KIIS due to a contract dispute and was replaced by After Dees left KIIS in a contract dispute, the young <a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a> was recruited to replace him. , a young .</p><p>Rigdon Osmond Dees III (born March 14, 1950), best known as Rick Dees, is an American entertainer, radio personality, comedian, actor, and voice artist, best known for his internationally syndicated radio show The Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 Countdown and for the 1976 novelty song “Disco Duck”. In 2007 he sang the theme song for the TV show Rick and Steve.</p><p>His introduction to the international entertainment arena began while working at WMPS AM 680 (“The Great 68”) in Memphis, Tennessee, during the disco craze of the mid- to late-1970s, when he wrote and recorded “Disco Duck” in 1976, that sold more than 6 million copies. The song can be heard in Saturday Night Fever, in a brief scene in which a group of older people were learning to “move their feet to the disco beat”. While this platinum recording earned him a People’s Choice Award for Favorite New Song, and the BMI Award for record sales in one year, Dees was expressly forbidden from playing the song on the air by station management (rival stations refused to play it for fear of promoting their competition). Dees was fired from WMPS when he mentioned that his song, “Disco Duck”, was almost #1, and his own radio station would not let him play it. The station manager said it was a conflict of interest. Dees did not perform the actual duck vocals on the song since he could not “talk like a duck.” The duck vocals were recorded at Shoestring Productions in Memphis, Tennessee by Ken Pruitt, who moved away before the song became popular, and the vocals for the duck were done by Michael Chesney of Memphis for the concert tour. Chesney had done some comedic voices for Dees prior to Disco Duck. The tour went from Disney World to New York, NY, billed as Rick Dees and The Cast of Idiots. After a 45-day non-compete clause in his contract was satisfied, Dees was hired by RKO Radio to do the morning show at WHBQ AM 560 in Memphis.</p><p align=justify>He was married to&nbsp;He married <a href=#>Julie McWhirter</a>, a popular comedienne in her own right, who helped him compose the unique sound effects to his countdown show.&nbsp;who is a well-known comedienne, and helped him create the unique sound effects for his countdown show.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rick Dees</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Dees</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>DJ</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 14</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jacksonville</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Julie McWhirter , Nancy Carmody</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kevin Dees</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Rick Dees ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
