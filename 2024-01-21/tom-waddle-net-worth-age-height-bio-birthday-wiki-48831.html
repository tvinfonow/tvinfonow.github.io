Sportscaster and Former NFL player, best recognized for his role as host of the ESPN radio show Waddle and Silvy and as an analyst for NFL Network.&nbsp;He spent the entirety of his six-year NFL time as a player of the Chicago Bears, leading the team in receiving yards between 1992 and 1993.</p><p>He has stepped the shoes of&nbsp;He has filled in for <a href=#>Mike Greenberg</a> on ESPN Radio’s Mike and Mike in the Morning.&nbsp;in the ESPN radio show Mike in the Morning and Mike in the morning.</p><p>In 1989, the Chicago Bears signed Waddle as an undrafted free agent. During his first two years with the Bears, he struggled to make an impact as a receiver. Waddle lacked the size and speed to distinguish himself from other Bears wide receivers and remained on the lower rungs of the team’s depth chart. He received a chance to start in 1991 after the Bears lost starters due to injuries. In a nationally televised Monday night game against the Jets, he made eight catches for 102 yards in an overtime win. In Chicago’s wild card playoff loss to Dallas (17-13), Waddle was the Bears’ sole standout performer on the offensive side of the ball, catching nine passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. His performance established him as a mainstay in the Bears lineup and clinched him a spot on the famed All-Madden Team.</p><p>After finishing the 1992 season with a record of 5–11, coach Mike Ditka was fired and Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt was brought in to replace him. After leading the Bears in receiving yards and receptions in 1993, Wannstedt demoted Waddle in favor of faster receivers. Later that year, he suffered a concussion and a partially torn knee ligament from an illegal hit by Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive back Thomas Everett. The following off-season, the Bears offered Waddle a choice between a guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary, and a more lucrative deal that would be dissolved if he were cut. He instead attended the Cincinnati Bengals’ training camp, but elected to retire, as he felt that his lingering leg injuries no longer allowed him to compete at the professional level.</p><p align=justify>He was married to a woman named Cara She has the father of the AFL Hall of Famer Gino Cappelletti.&nbsp;They have two children together.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom Waddle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Waddle</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sportscaster</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cincinnati</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Cara Waddle</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Georgia Waddle, Angela Rae Waddle</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Tom Waddle ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
