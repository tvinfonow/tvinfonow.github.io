In June 2015 Camden became the World Champion of Doubles alongside Tim Chisholm, winning the event hosted in Tuxedo Park, NY over the previous champions by a score of 5 sets to 0. Following the WCD, Camden successfully defended his US Professional Singles title, winning the tournament for the 6th consecutive year in a row, and in the process completing an undefeated 2014/2015 season.</p><p align=justify>Camden was re-established as a touring professional in November 2011 and is now based in Charleston, South Carolina.&nbsp;Camden, who has been a touring professional since November 2011, has amassed a lot of titles.
