American soul singer and songwriter, best known for being a member the DeBarge family band, who are known for hits like A Dream (I Like It) and A Dream (DeBarge).</p><p>She was a member of DeBarge with brother&nbsp;She and brother <a href=#>El DeBarge</a> were members of DeBarge..</p><p>Bunny found solace in music, singing in her uncle’s church as a child. She and her brothers soon participated in several groups together in various times. In 1972, DeBarge dropped out of school and married her first husband, for whom she’d be the mother of two children (they later divorced). Since she wasn’t into instruments like her brothers were, Bunny taught herself how to write songs and compose melodies, which later paid off as she got older.</p><p>Between 1979 and 1981, Bunny and her brothers worked behind the scenes mainly on the works of Switch, with Bunny in particular collaborating with her brother Bobby on songs such as “Hold On to My Love”, “Love Over and Over Again” and “My Friend in the Sky”. In 1981, Bunny co-produced the DeBarges’ self-titled debut album and was featured on lead vocals alongside brother El on “Share My World” which they wrote. A year later, in 1982, the group brought along their teenage brother James, and shortened their name to just DeBarge. That year, they released their second album, All This Love, with which the siblings found musical success, particularly with “I Like It”, for which Bunny wrote parts of the lyrics, alongside her brothers Randy and El.</p><p align=justify>She is the oldest of ten siblings, many of which were DeBarge members.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bunny Debarge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bunny</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Debarge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soul Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Detroit</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michigan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Bobby DeBarge, James DeBarge, El DeBarge, MORE</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Janae Jordan</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bunny Debarge ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The album yielded another hit with Bunny as a lyricist, with the gospel-influenced “Time_Will_Reveal_(song)”. The album also included several more highlights including two more Bunny-composed ballads, “Stay with Me” and “A Dream”, the last song Bunny took lead vocals on. Like All This Love before it, In a Special Way went gold, paving the way for the group’s biggest success in 1985 with the Rhythm of the Night album, with the title track becoming a top five crossover hit.

The album failed to deliver any hits or stay on the charts long and Bunny soon left the label. Besieged by a growing drug addiction that had started during her heyday with DeBarge, she quietly exited from the music business at the end of the 1980s and with the exception of projects involving gospel music, including an album featuring some of her brothers, herself and their mother, Bunny hasn’t released any more solo work.</p><p>Bunny entered rehab several times to kick her habit. In 2008, she broke her silence issuing her autobiography, The Kept Ones, in which she talked about her father’s abuse towards her and her siblings and her dealings with substance abuse. That year she appeared on the debut episode of the TV One series, Unsung, in which she talked about her childhood and her time with DeBarge, along with brothers Randy and James. The trio again appeared on TV three years later in September 2011, on the show Lifechangers alongside Bunny’s daughter Janae. James entered the rehabilitation program but left a few hours later. Randy left a few days later. Bunny entered the rehabilitation program and completed her entire experience. After leaving the rehabilitation program in West Hollywood, California, Bunny has been touring and focusing on her new album.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bunny Debarge height</b> Not available right now.
