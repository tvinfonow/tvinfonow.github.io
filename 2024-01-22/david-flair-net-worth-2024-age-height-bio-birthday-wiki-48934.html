He appeared on camera backstage with his father at Starrcade 1993 in World Championship Wrestling. In the storyline, his father was going to have to “retire” if he lost his match, so his family appeared to increase the emotion.

He made up with his father who then had the Four Horsemen help Flair win matches. Ric, being the on-screen WCW President, stripped WCW United States Champion Scott Steiner of his title and awarded it to Flair.

Before that could happen though, it was revealed that Stacy was pregnant and that David was not the father. This led to Flair trying to figure out who the father was with the help of Ric, whom he had made up with, and Anderson. He even had a match with Buff Bagwell to get Bagwell’s DNA. This storyline ended abruptly when Miss Hancock returned to television with Shawn “The Star” Stasiak and a baby carriage in the ring. Instead of a baby, however, it was revealed that there were 8×10 pictures of Shawn in the carriage. After this angle, Flair was no longer seen in WCW as a competitor.</p><p>Flair was joined by Daffney at Starrcade in 1999. He was joined a little later by Crowbar. They formed a team and won the vacant WCW World Tag Team Titles in a tournament final on January 3, 2000 over Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner with Anderson as the special referee. They lost the titles to Big Vito and Johnny the Bull, “The Mamalukes,” on January 19. Flair soon split with Crowbar and in May 2000, joined Vince Russo’s New Blood. He dumped Daffney and took Miss Hancock (Stacy Keibler) as his valet. He also turned on his father again which led to a match against him at The Great American Bash. Flair lost, but the next night, he won a match against his father to retire him and shave his father’s head.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>David Flair height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> David <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>He eventually decided to become a wrestler and teamed with his father in his debut match at WCW/nWo Souled Out on January 17, 1999. Fliehr wrestled under his father’s altered surname of “Flair”. They wrestled Curt Hennig and Barry Windham and won the match. After the match, the entire nWo came out, and Hollywood Hogan lashed David with his belt until David’s back (and stomach where the belt whipped around and struck) was full of welts while his father was handcuffed to the ring ropes. In his autobiography, Ric Flair alleges that Hogan took liberties with his son by whipping him far more times than agreed upon and that he would never forgive Hogan for this.

Nash told Ric that his number one priority was to become the number one contender to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was held by Scott Steiner. His number two priority was getting a rematch for Dustin Rhodes against Rick Steiner, who was WCW U.S. Champion at the time.
