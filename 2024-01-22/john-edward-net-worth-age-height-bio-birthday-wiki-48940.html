His appearance on Larry King Live catapulted him to fame and led to the inception of Crossing Over with John Edward.

His related appearance on Larry King Live later in the year prompted enough phone calls to overload the show’s switchboard. The next year, Edward had a show of his own.</p><p>Born in Glen Cove, New York, Edward says he was convinced at a young age that he could become a psychic. After writing his first book on the subject in 1998, Edward became a well-known and controversial figure in the United States with his shows broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel beginning in July 2000 and We TV since May 2006.</p><p align=justify>In Glen Cove, New York and educated to an Roman Catholic faith by a father of Irish descent as well as an mother of Italian descent.&nbsp;His union with Sandra McGee resulted in children named Justin and Olivia.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John Edward</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>John</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Edward</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 19</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Glen Cove</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Perinda McGee, Jack McGee</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sandra Edward</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Olivia Edward</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>John Edward ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race? Let's check it out! As per public resource, IMDb & Wikipedia, John Edward's ethnicity is Not Known. We will update John Edward's religion & political views in this article. Please check the article again after few days.</p><p>From 2001 to 2004, Edward was the producer and host of the show Crossing Over with John Edward, which has been syndicated and was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States and on Living TV in the UK. In Crossing Over, Edward gave psychic readings to audience members.</p><h2>John Edward Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>John Edward is one of the <strong>richest TV Show Host</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>John Edward</b>'s net worth <strong>$3 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Before becoming a professional psychic, he was an assistant to a doctor and dance instructor.</p><p align=justify>The parapsychologist Gary Schwartz tested Edward’s psychic abilities and claimed they were authentic, but psychologist and skeptical Ray Hyman challenged Schwartz’s methodology and conclusion.</p><p align=justify>John Edward McGee Jr. (born October 19, 1969), known professionally as John Edward, is an American television personality, author and purported psychic medium.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Underdown also claimed that Edward’s apparent accuracy on television may be inflated by the editing process. After watching the broadcast version of the show he had attended and recorded, Underdown attributed a great deal of Edward’s accuracy on television to editing and wrote, “Edward’s editor fine-tuned many of the dead-ends out of a reading riddled with misses.” In 2002, Edward said, “People are in the studio for eight hours, and we have to edit the show for time, not content. We don’t try to hide the ‘misses’.” Edward has denied ever using hot or cold reading techniques.</p><p>Critics of John Edward assert that he performs the mentalist techniques of hot reading and cold reading, in which one respectively uses prior knowledge or a wide array of quick and sometimes general guesses to create the impression of psychic ability. Choosing the first reading from a two-hour tape of edited shows as a sample, illusionist and skeptic James Randi found that just three of 23 statements made by Edward were confirmed as correct by the audience member being read, and the three statements that were correct were also trivial and nondescript. In another incident, Edward was said to have used foreknowledge to hot read in an interview on the television show Dateline. James Underdown of the Independent Investigative Group (IIG) attended a Crossing Over show in November 2002 and said “there were no indications of anyone I saw collecting information… none of his readings contained the kind of specific information that would raise an eyebrow of suspicion. … John Edward was a bad cold reader. He, too, struggled to get hits, and in one attempt shot off nearly 40 guesses before finding any significant targets.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>John Edward height</b> Not available right now.

According to Edward’s autobiography, he did not know that the producers had chosen the victims’ families to appear on the show. The trade magazine Broadcasting & Cable sent a story, “‘Psychic’ Plans WTC Victims Show”, on the daily subscription-fax sent to news media and TV-station executives on October 25, 2001.</p><p align=justify>Gary Schwartz, a psychologist and researcher in the field of parapsychology, designed and administered a series of tests for Edward and several other mediums to investigate their paranormal claims and published his belief that Edward’s abilities were genuine in his book The Afterlife Experiments. The study did not undergo scientific peer review, and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry’s Ray Hyman, a psychologist and critic of parapsychology, wrote a detailed critique of Schwartz’s methodology and conclusions in a 2003 issue of the Skeptical Inquirer. Schwartz responded to the critique, leading Hyman to write a rebuttal.</p><h2>Who is John Edward Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>John Edward</strong> married to <strong>Sandra Edward </strong>.
