Who is Michael Smerconish dating now & how much money does Michael Smerconish have?</p><h2>Michael Smerconish Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Michael Smerconish</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Radio Host</strong> who was born on <strong>March 15, 1962</strong> in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, <strong>United States</strong>. Author, lawyer, political commentator, and talk show host.&nbsp;His first talk show was broadcast by Philadelphia’s 1210 AM WPHT radio station.&nbsp;The shows were broadcast on seventy US radio stations.&nbsp;CNN hired him in 2014 to host a live show one week.</p><p>He was a senior official at the Office of Housing and Urban Development in his late twenties under President&nbsp;In his late twenties, he served under President <a href=#>George Bush</a> as a high-ranking official in the Office of Housing and Urban Development..</p><p>In 1980, Smerconish founded Lehigh University Youth for Reagan/Bush. While a full-time student at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, he ran for the Pennsylvania state legislature, losing the Republican Primary by 419 votes. After losing his primary, Smerconish continued at Penn Law, while working nearly full-time running political campaigns. In 1986, he was responsible for the City of Philadelphia in Senator Arlen Specter’s re-election win, and in 1987, Smerconish served as Rizzo’s Political Director in Rizzo’s losing (Republican) bid to re-take City Hall. After graduating from Penn Law, he opened up a title insurance agency with his brother Wally, before being appointed, at age 29, by the administration of President George H.W. Bush to serve as the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Regional Administrator for Philadelphia Region III (consisting of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia) under Secretary Jack Kemp.</p><p>His media work grew out of his unique political experiences at an early age (working for Vice President Bush, running unsuccessfully for the state legislature, running campaigns for Arlen Specter and Frank Rizzo and ultimately being appointed to a sub-cabinet-level position by President George H.W. Bush). In the spring of 1990, Smerconish made his first radio appearance as a guest of a guest-host, Brian Tierney, who was then a substitute host on Philadelphia talk station 96.5 FM WWDB. During the 1991 Philadelphia mayoral election, Smerconish worked at WWDB as a political analyst. He then transitioned from a guest to a guest-host. By 1993, he had his own program Sunday nights from 8 p.m. until midnight, during which time his day job was the practice of law. In 1996, after the death of longtime broadcaster Dominic Quinn, Smerconish moved to Saturday and Sunday mornings, the latter of which allowed him to be the lead-in of Sid Mark’s Sunday with Sinatra. WWDB was then sold by broadcast entrepreneurs Chuck and Susan Schwartz and a new owner began selling informercials masked as programming which Smerconish refused to honor. That led to his 1997 move to CBS affiliate WPHT (formerly known as WCAU AM). By the following year, he was moved to afternoon drive, all the while maintaining his practice of law. Only when in September of 2003, after the firing of Don Imus, whose morning drive slot he took, did Smerconish become a talk show host who was a lawyer instead of a lawyer who was a talk show host.</p><p align=justify>He was the son of a Yugoslavian, Italian and Ukrainian family.&nbsp;Walter Smerconish was his father and Florence Grovich was his mother.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael Smerconish</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Michael</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Smerconish</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Radio Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 15</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1962</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Doylestown</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pennsylvania</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lavinia Smerconish</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michael Smerconish Jr.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Michael Smerconish ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Despite being convicted and sentenced to death by a Philadelphia jury for the murder of Faulkner, Mumia Abu-Jamal became a cause celebre for death penalty opponents around the world.

In a 2,000-word essay for Salon titled “Why this lifelong Republican may vote for Obama,” citing the Republican Party’s failure to capture Osama bin Laden after seven years of war, he wrote, “All of this drives me bat-shit, and it just might drive me into the Obama camp. That’d be quite a departure.”</p><p>He then returned to the subject of 9/11 for his fifth book, Instinct: The Man Who Stopped the 20th Hijacker (2009), which tells the true story of Jose Melendez-Perez, a Customs and Border Protection Inspector at Orlando International Airport, who thwarted the entry of Mohammed al Qahtani, the 20th hijacker, one month before 9/11. Once again, Smerconish gave all author profits to charity, this time, the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Smerconish subsequently sought to credit Melendez-Perez with playing a role in the killing of Osama bin Laden because he denied al Qahtani’s entry and Qahtani, as a prisoner of war in Guantanamo Bay, was one of the detainees who identified bin Laden’s courier, leading to the successful raid of SEAL Team Six.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Michael Smerconish height</b> Not available right now.
