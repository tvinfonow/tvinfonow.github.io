Commanding vocalist and lead singer for The rock band Boston The group who released the smash hit “More Than a Feeling.”</p><p>He as well as&nbsp;He and <a href=#>Tom Scholz</a> were both in Boston.&nbsp;were both living in Boston.</p><p>Bradley Edward Delp (June 12, 1951 – March 9, 2007) was an American singer and songwriter, widely known as the lead vocalist of the rock bands Boston and RTZ.</p><p>In 1969, guitarist Barry Goudreau introduced Delp to Tom Scholz, who was looking for a singer to complete some demo recordings. Eventually, Scholz formed the short-lived band Mother’s Milk (1973–74), including Delp and Goudreau. After producing a demo, Epic Records eventually signed the act. Mother’s Milk was renamed Boston, and the self-titled debut album (recorded in 1975, although many tracks had been written years before) was released in August 1976. Delp performed all of the lead and all backing harmony vocals, including all layered vocal overdubs.</p><p align=justify>He was planning to get married to Pamela Sullivan at the time when he died.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brad Delp</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Brad</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Delp</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rock Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>June 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Peabody</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Gemini</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Brad Delp ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

A series of interviews conducted by the Boston Herald alleged that lingering hard feelings from Boston’s disbandment in the 1980s and personal tension between Delp and bandleader Scholz drove the singer to commit suicide. Scholz denied these claims but lost the defamation suits he filed in response. Court documents from the trials detail Scholz stating that Delp was plagued by personal problems. Boston Herald attorneys pointed to testimony from former Boston members, other local musicians, Delp’s doctor, and Delp’s friends, including Meg Sullivan (his fiancée’s sister), many of whom say the singer did not like Scholz, desperately wanted to quit the band, and felt tormented by his role as middleman in an ugly conflict between Scholz and former band members. All of this was summarized in a 140-page statement filed by the Herald in April 2012.</p><h2>Brad Delp Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Brad Delp is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United States.

On February 28, 2007, Meg discovered a hidden camera planted in her room. After confronting Delp, he admitted to planting the camera and later wrote a series of emails pleading for forgiveness. Todd Winmill, Meg’s boyfriend, implored Delp to admit his wrongdoings to Pamela on March 3. After promising to tell her in a few days, Delp purchased the grills and tubing he later used to commit suicide. Pamela found his body on March 9. In the bathroom were several notes written by Delp, one of which read: “I have had bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide since I was a teenager … [Pamela] was my ‘ray of sunshine’, but sometimes even a ray of sunshine is no substitute for a good psychiatrist.”</p><h3>Was Brad Delp a good singer?</h3><p><b>Brad Delp has been called “the nicest guy in rock and roll”</b> and his velvety, smooth voice is impossible not to recognize.
