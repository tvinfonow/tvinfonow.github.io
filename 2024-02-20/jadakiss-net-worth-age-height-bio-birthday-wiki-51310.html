Bush coordinated the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p><h2>Jadakiss Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jadakiss is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States.

At the age of 12 he began selling drugs after his parents asked him to earn his own money. He soon stopped selling drugs, however, and instead began freestyle rapping for money after watching other people do it on the street corner. While freestyling, he eventually met longtime friends Sheek Louch and Styles P.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jadakiss began embarking on a solo career in 2001 and his debut album, Kiss Tha Game Goodbye, was released in August on the Ruff Ryders/Interscope label. The album featured popular guests and producers such as DJ Premier, The Alchemist, DMX, Eve, Snoop Dogg , Nas and Swizz Beatz and was commercially successful, going on to be certified gold by the RIAA and selling over 200,000 copies during its first week of release. Despite commercial success, the album received negative reception from critics who criticised the album for being repetitive and uninspired. Jadakiss has acknowledged the criticism as valid, saying the record was done less out of inspiration but rather out of contractual obligations to Bad Boy. The album produced three singles, “We Gonna Make It” featuring Styles P, “Knock Yourself Out” and “Put Ya Hands Up”. Jadakiss followed this album with Kiss of Death, released in June 2004. It features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Eminem, The Lox, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Nate Dogg, DJ Quik and more. His song “Why?”, featuring Anthony Hamilton and produced by Havoc of Mobb Deep, became one of the year’s biggest hits, spawning a remix featuring Styles P, Common and Nas. “Why?” remains Jadakiss’ biggest hit, peaking at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also garnered controversy for a line in which Jadakiss claims that he believes George W. Bush planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Another single from the record, “U Make Me Wanna,” featuring Mariah Carey peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album was both a commercial and critical success, receiving better reviews than his previous album and debuted at number 1 on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums charts. In late 2007, Jadakiss signed to Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella Records, a move Jay had been trying to arrange for a long time. The move came on the heels of increased D-Block/Roc-a-Fella collaborations; in 2006, Jadakiss and former rival Beanie Sigel collaborated on DJ Khaled’s album Listennn… the Album, and in 2007, on Freeway’s album Free At Last. Styles P appeared on a radio freestyle with Freeway and Sigel, and also appeared briefly in the video for Jay-Z’s American Gangster single “Roc Boys,” in which he throws up the famous Roc-a-Fella sign, “the Diamond.”</p><p>In July 2004, Jadakiss was arrested in North Carolina on marijuana and illicit gun-possession charges. Several months later, he reached a plea agreement on misdemeanor charges and was ordered to pay a $900 fine.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jadakiss height</b> <strong>5 feet 7 inches</strong> Jadakiss <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Upon signing with Bad Boy, Puff Daddy shortened the group’s name from The Warlocks to simply The Lox. They made their first appearance on The Main Source’s 1994 LP Fuck What You Think on the track “Set it Off.” They immediately began writing and performing on hit songs with fellow Bad Boy artists, including Puff Daddy’s “It’s All About the Benjamins” and “I Got the Power”, Mase’s “24 Hrs. to Live”, Mariah Carey’s “Honey”, Mary J. Blige’s “Can’t Get You Off My Mind” and The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Last Day”. The group developed a close relationship with B.I.G., during which time Jadakiss especially was taken under his wing. The Lox’s first hit song was a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. in the wake of his 1997 death, titled “We’ll Always Love Big Poppa”. The song was chosen as the B-side to Puff Daddy’s smash hit B.I.G. tribute song “I’ll Be Missing You”, and received widespread commercial success, achieving multi-platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The success and reception of the song opened the door for them to write more of their own songs, and in 1998, the Lox released their debut studio album, Money, Power & Respect. The album was both a commercial and critical success, peaking at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and went on to achieve platinum status. Though the record was successful, The Lox grew unhappy with Bad Boy Records and Puff Daddy’s glossy, radio friendly production, feeling it conflicted with their grimier street aesthetic. Following the release of their debut album, the group left the label to sign with Ruff Ryders Entertainment. They released their second album, We Are The Streets in 2000, through Ruff Ryders. The album was once again a success, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 2 on the US Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. It featured production from Swizz Beatz and Timbaland, and spawned one single, “Ryde Or Die, Bitch”, featuring fellow Ruff Ryders artist Eve.</p><p align=justify>In 2004, Jadakiss and Fat Joe were featured on a song by Ja Rule titled “New York”. In this song, Ja Rule accuses 50 Cent of being a snitch, and also takes shots at 50’s G Unit group. In turn, 50 Cent released a song titled “Piggy Bank” in which he disses Fat Joe and Jadakiss among others for performing on the song. This caused Jadakiss to release numerous 50 Cent diss tracks, including “Checkmate”, “Problem Child”, “Shots Fired” and “I’m Sorry Ms. Jackson”. 50 Cent along with his G-Unit crew responded with songs such as “I Run New York”, “Window Shopper”, and “Death Wish” by Lloyd Banks. Jadakiss challenged 50 Cent to an onstage battle in Madison Square Garden for 1 million dollars, but 50 Cent declined. The feud was later resolved, with Jadakiss and G-Unit performing together at 50 Cent’s ThisIs50 Festival on October 3, 2009.</p><h2>Who is Jadakiss Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jadakiss</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
