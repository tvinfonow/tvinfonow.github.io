Most Web sites here have bulletin boards where users can post uncensored, anonymous comments, and nearly all young people run their own blogs, updating via cellphone. Such sites were a major avenue for rumors about the possible dangers of dropping a ban on American beef that fed enormous street protests and political upheaval earlier this year. Major Web portals have in recent years doubled the number of monitors to screen out online character assassination and respond more quickly to complaints of malicious rumors.

For nearly 20 years, Choi was the country’s cinematic sweetheart and as close to being a “national” actress as possible. But since her body was found on Oct. 2, an apparent suicide, she has become a symbol of the difficulties women face in this deeply conservative yet technologically savvy society. Incessant online gossip appears to have been largely to blame for her death. But it’s also clear that public life as a single, working, divorced mom—still a pariah status in South Korea—was one role she had a lot of trouble with,” Time commented on her death on October 6, 2008.</p><p align=justify>On August 15, 2009, Choi’s ashes were stolen from her burial site.
