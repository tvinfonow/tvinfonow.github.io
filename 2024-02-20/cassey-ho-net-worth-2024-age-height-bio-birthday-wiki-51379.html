She also interned with Effie’s Heart (a San Jose-based clothing company.) Ho started posting fitness videos on YouTube in 2009 after she decided to move from Los Angeles, California to Boston, Massachusetts for a full-time job as a fashion buyer. She had been a part-time Pilates instructor and wanted to provide the students she was leaving with online fitness workouts after she moved to Boston. The first video she uploaded to YouTube was called “POP Pilates: Total Body Sculpt video” and she had considerable trouble with its quality, audio, and editing.

According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Cassey Ho</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She designed gym and yoga bags for oGorgeous after graduating from Whittier College.</p><p align=justify>The last time she tried chocolate was in the first grade. She hated the taste.</p><p align=justify>Cassey Ho (born January 16, 1987) is an American social media fitness entrepreneur with a YouTube channel and a website that sells fitness apparel. She is considered an Internet personality and a rising YouTube star nationally and internationally. In 2013, she received a Shorty Award in the category of social fitness. She believes that her role on the Internet is more than a Pilates instructor; she believes that she should promote an overall healthy lifestyle and body image. It was in this context, in 2014, that she discovered a photo of a model on Target Corporation’s website with a photoshopped thigh gap and wrote critically about its health implications on her blog. Target subsequently apologized for altering the photo. In April 2015, Ho responded to negative comments about her body by creating a YouTube video called The “Perfect” Body. In 2017, Ho was listed in Time’s third annual list of “The 25 Most Influential People on the Internet”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>YouTube Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>She was interviewed by Forbes in 2012 as a woman who is rapidly becoming a star on YouTube along with several other women such as Issa Rae and Cassandra Bankson. She has been described as an Internet personality and as a poster child for Asian American entrepreneurial success on the Internet. At the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, she led yogilates workout sessions at the YouTube lounge.</p><p>She told Asian Fortune that coming from an Asian culture, her parents expected her to choose a career as a doctor or lawyer. When she was 16, she told her father that she wanted to be a fashion designer and her father told her that she would fail, make no money, and have no friends. However, in August 2014, when she released her BodyPop line of clothes, Ho said that both of her parents are now supportive of her efforts. It was hard for her parents to accept her career path into social fitness on the Internet, but she said they came to accept it. She found that when she started her Blogilates website she found that when it started to gain popularity, she couldn’t keep up with creating content for it and she asked her parents to help with the logistics and management of her business. Her mother now helps her with overseas shipments of her products and her father helps her with operations management as well as the logistics of running her businesses.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Cassey Ho height</b> <strong>5 ft 5 in</strong> Cassey <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 5 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Nine months after she moved to Boston to work as a fashion buyer, she decided to quit because she disliked it. She started teaching Pilates classes 12 times a week to pay for her food and rent. She found teaching Pilates this often physically tiring, but because she was not working full-time, she had time to make more workout videos. She began uploading her new videos to YouTube and her views and subscribers began to rapidly increase. She then became a YouTube Partner and her website blogilates.com dramatically increased its web traffic. She also believes that a feature of one of her bags in Shape magazine in 2010 was a contributing factor in the success she has had in her career. After her bag was featured, she realized that she could make money selling bags and went to China to talk to manufacturers of bags. When she started her YouTube channel and began her Internet marketing of clothing, bags, mats, and fitness apparel, she briefly worked with a PR company, but decided she could handle PR for her businesses.</p><p align=justify>In August 2014, Ho released “Bodypop”, an activewear clothing collection. According to Ro Kalonaros, writing for Shape, “The line is a mix between high fashion and practical—think peplum and bold prints.” At the release of her activewear collection, Ho also released a music video of three female athletes wearing Ho’s activewear. The line appears to have been discontinued, with bodypopactive.com now redirecting to ogorgeous.com. In January 2016, Ho launched the first collection of a new line, “Popflex.”</p><h2>Who is Cassey Ho Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Cassey Ho</strong> married to <strong>Sam Livits </strong>.
