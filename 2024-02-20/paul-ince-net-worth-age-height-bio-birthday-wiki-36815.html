Midfielder who was a part of the English national team from 1992 until 2000.&nbsp;He was awarded the two Premier League titles as a midfielder for Manchester United in 1993 and 1994.</p><p>He was on the team with&nbsp;He was teammates with <a href=#>David Beckham</a> on Manchester United from 1993 to 1995.&nbsp;on Manchester United from 1993 to 1995.</p><p>He signed for the Hammers as a trainee, aged 14. Lyall helped Ince through troubled school times eventually signing him as a YTS trainee, on leaving school, in 1984. He is a product of the West Ham youth team and made his debut in English football on 30 November 1986 against Newcastle United in the First Division. He became a regular player in 1987–88, proving himself to have all-round qualities of pace, stamina, uncompromising tackling and good passing ability. He also packed a powerful shot, and was awarded with England under-21 honours to go with the youth caps he acquired as an apprentice. He firmly established himself as the successor in West Ham’s midfield for the veteran Billy Bonds, who retired at the end of the 1987–88 season. Unfortunately for Ince, West Ham were not enjoying one of their best spells when he broke into the team. Despite having won the FA Cup in 1980 and finished third in the league in 1986, they had failed to sustain their challenge for major honours and finished 15th in 1987 and 16th in 1988, and worse was to follow.</p><p>In August 1988, an eventful season for Ince began. In a struggling West Ham side, he shot to national recognition with two stunning goals in a shock 4–1 win over defending league champions Liverpool in the League Cup, and continued to score goals as the Hammers reached the semi-finals while having real trouble finding any form in the League. West Ham lost to Luton Town in the semi-finals and, despite frequent displays of individual brilliance from Ince, were relegated at the end of the season, a disappointment which cost manager John Lyall his job after 15 years at the helm. West Ham’s relegation sparked inevitable speculation that Ince would be sold to a First Division club, with Manchester United being among the clubs being linked to Ince’s signature.</p><p align=justify>The place where he was raised is Ilford, London, England.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul Ince</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Paul</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ince</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Soccer Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>England</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Paul Ince ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

That said, Ince was in the Wolves team which won promotion to the Premier League as Division One playoff winners in his first season. They were relegated after just one season in the top flight (their first since 1983–84), but Ince helped them beat his old club Manchester United 1–0 in mid January and chose to stay with Wolves despite their relegation.</p><p align=justify>Meanwhile, Ince became United’s key midfielder, with snapping tackles, raking passes and some tremendously hit shots, though he was not too prolific a goalscorer.

A year later and Ince suffered more of the all too familiar chants of “Judas” when he and Manchester United went to West Ham on the last day of the season, needing a win to retain their Premier League crown. They could only draw the game and Blackburn Rovers took the title. Ince’s next game saw them lose the FA Cup final to Everton, leaving United without a major trophy for the first time in six seasons. During that season, his central midfield partner Roy Keane had missed 17 of United’s 42 league games due to injury, meaning that Ince often found himself partnered with Brian McClair and – particularly towards the end of the season – the 20-year-old Nicky Butt.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Paul Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Soccer Player</strong>.
