Who is Kevin Brennan dating now & how much money does Kevin Brennan have?</p><h2>Kevin Brennan Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Kevin Brennan</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Politician</strong> who was born on <strong>October 16, 1959</strong> in Cwmbran, Cwmbran, <strong>United Kingdom</strong>. Kevin Denis Brennan (born 16 October 1959) is a British Labour Party politician who was first elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardiff West in 2001, and was a Minister of State at both the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Children, Schools and Families before the 2010 general election. His responsibilities included Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs.</p><p>Following Rhodri Morgan’s decision to step down as the Member of Parliament for Cardiff West in order to concentrate on being the First Minister of Wales, Brennan was selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency and became the MP for Cardiff West at the 2001 general election. In 2002, he appeared in the House of Commons without a tie, as he favours a less formal dress code.</p><p>In July 2002, the steel manufacturer Allied Steel and Wire (ASW) entered receivership and many of their employees were told they would not receive their full company pensions because of a fund shortfall. Mr Brennan, who had many former workers of Allied Steel & Wire as constituents, tabled an early day motion in the Commons in November calling for compensation and threatened to table an amendment to the Pensions Bill if the government did not offer any help. After Brennan carried out his threat to table the amendment, The Independent newspaper reported that Tony Blair faced the “biggest backbench rebellion” of his career. Ultimately, Brennan was successful. The BBC said he was “instrumental in extracting the government’s commitment to establish a £400 million fund to provide compensation for workers who lost their pensions when their firms went bankrupt”.</p><p>After the 2005 general election, he was promoted to Tony Blair’s government as an Assistant Government Whip. In June 2007, Blair’s successor, Gordon Brown, appointed Brennan as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families in the new Department for Children, Schools and Families, replacing Parmjit Dhanda. Brennan was replaced in this role by Lady Morgan following the government reshuffle in October 2008. He was moved to the Cabinet Office before being promoted in 2009, becoming the Minister of State for Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs with responsibilities in both the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Following the 2010 General Election, he continued this role in a Shadow Ministerial capacity before Ed Miliband’s decision to appoint Brennan to the position of Shadow Minister for Schools.</p><p align=justify>Brennan has been married to Amy Lynn Wack since 1988; the couple have one daughter. Brennan supports Cardiff City Football Club and the Cardiff Blues rugby team. He is also a member of a parliamentary rock band MP4 with fellow politicians Ian Cawsey, Pete Wishart and Greg Knight. They have helped to raise over £1 million for charity as well as releasing an album and an EP. They are currently the house band on the television show Unspun with Matt Forde.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin Brennan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kevin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Politician</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1959</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cwmbran</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cwmbran</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Neal Brennan, Sheila Krezwick</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Amy Wack</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kevin Brennan ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
