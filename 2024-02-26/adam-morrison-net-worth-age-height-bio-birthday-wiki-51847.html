According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Adam Morrison</b>'s net worth <strong>$8 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>He was the ball boy for the Gonzaga men’s basketball team before playing on the team.</p><p align=justify>After his time with the Bobcats, from 2006 to 2009, he spent two years with the Lakers then played professionally in Serbia and Turkey.</p><p align=justify>Adam John Morrison (born July 19, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player. Morrison played for three years at Gonzaga University and was considered to be one of the top college basketball players in 2005–06. He was a finalist for the Naismith and the Wooden Award. He was named Co-Player of the Year with Duke’s J. J. Redick by the United States Basketball Writers Association and won the 2006 Chevrolet Player of the Year award. He played for the NBA teams Charlotte Bobcats from 2006 to 2009 and L.A. Lakers in 2009-2010.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Morrison was selected 3rd overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Charlotte Bobcats, behind Andrea Bargnani (Toronto Raptors) and LaMarcus Aldridge (Chicago Bulls). On July 6, 2006, the Bobcats signed Morrison to a two-year contract. On November 1, 2006, in his NBA debut against the Indiana Pacers he scored 14 points. He was the first player drafted by Manager of Basketball Operations Michael Jordan in his tenure with the Bobcats. He scored his career high on December 30, 2006, with 30 points in a win against the Indiana Pacers. However, Morrison lost his starting spot midway through his rookie season, in part because of his defense and in part because he shot only 37% for the year.</p><p>Morrison led the Zags with 24 points in a 2006 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen match against UCLA, which the Zags lost in the final seconds after UCLA had eliminated a 17-point deficit coming out of the first half. With seconds left, the lead having slipped away after Morrison’s teammates committed 3 turnovers in less than 5 seconds, Morrison broke down in tears and collapsed to the court. He was eventually helped to his feet by UCLA player Arron Afflalo. He has been both criticized and praised for this unbridled show of emotion. He later shared the national player of the year award with friendly rival J. J. Redick of Duke. The game against UCLA turned out to be Morrison’s final collegiate game, as he later decided to turn pro, foregoing his senior year of college.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Adam Morrison height</b> <strong>6 feet 8 inches</strong> Adam <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 feet 8 inches</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In his junior year during Gonzaga’s first two games of the 2005–06 season at the Maui Invitational, Morrison played well against two of the sport’s top programs. In the first round, Morrison scored 25 points in a Gonzaga win over Maryland. He followed up this performance with 43 points in a triple-overtime win over Michigan State in the semifinals. He matched that output against in-state rival Washington on December 4, 2005, in a losing effort. However, Morrison and the Zags bounced back a week later, defeating Oklahoma State after he banked in a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Gonzaga a two-point lead and eventually the win.</p><p align=justify>On February 7, 2009, Morrison and Shannon Brown were traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vladimir Radmanović. Morrison won NBA championships with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010, but saw very limited playing time.
