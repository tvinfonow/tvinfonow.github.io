He is best remembered for creating the Nickelodeon animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Hillenburg served as the showrunner for the first three seasons of the show, which has become the fifth-longest-running American animated series.</p><p>Hillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration which he drew in third grade, depicting “a bunch of army men … kissing and hugging instead of fighting”, brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it. “Of course, this is 1970 … She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War]. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. … I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, ‘oh my gosh, look at that'”, Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew he “had some [creative] skill”. He asserted that his artistry came from his mother’s side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was “really, really gifted” and a “great painter”. In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was “knocked out” by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen’s The Killing of an Egg (1977). “That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on,” he recounted.</p><p align=justify>He was married&nbsp;He married <a href=#>Karen Hillenburg</a> and they had a son named Clay together.&nbsp;and they had one son named Clay together.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen Hillenburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Stephen</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hillenburg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1961</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Lawton</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oklahoma</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Karen Hillenburg</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Clay Hillenburg</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Stephen Hillenburg ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He minored in art, and claimed that “[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt.” In 1984, he earned his bachelor’s degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources. He intended to take a master’s degree, but said it would be in art: “Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art.”</p><h2>Stephen Hillenburg Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Stephen Hillenburg is one of the <strong>richest Director</strong> from United States.

Hillenburg Jr., worked for the U.S. military. His mother, Nancy (née Dufour), taught visually impaired students. When he was a year old, the family moved to Orange County, California, where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry. His younger brother, Bryan, eventually became a draftsman/designer as well. Hillenburg had no recollection of life in Oklahoma, only of growing up in Anaheim, California.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$120 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Director</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, an informative comic book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko’s Modern Life (1993–1996) after his success with The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), short films that he made while studying animation.</p><p>Some evidence shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg’s time at the Orange County Marine Institute. He indicated that children’s television series such as The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse (1987–1988) and Pee-wee’s Playhouse (1986–1991) “sparked something in [him].” He continued, “I don’t know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I’ll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it… It took me a few years to get [SpongeBob SquarePants] together.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Stephen Hillenburg height</b> Not available right now.

He hoped to work in a national park on the coast, and eventually found a job at the Orange County Marine Institute (now known as the Ocean Institute), an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. Hillenburg was a marine-biology teacher there for three years: “We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity and adaptation. Working there, I saw how enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures.” He stayed at the Dana Point Marina and was also a staff artist. Although “[i]t was a great experience” for him, during this period, Hillenburg realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession.</p><p align=justify>Hillenburg enrolled in CalArts’ Experimental Animation Program in 1989. About this decision, he said: “Changing careers like that is scary, but the irony is that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle.” He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considered his “Art Dad” and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg said, “[Engel] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, ‘Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.’ I don’t have any [prior experience in] animation really.” Hillenburg graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.</p><h2>Who is Stephen Hillenburg Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Stephen Hillenburg</strong> married to <strong>Karen Hillenburg </strong>.

Stephen Hillenburg celebrates birthday on August 21 of every year.</p><p align=justify>As he was developing the show’s concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: “I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays.” It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, “something that was fantastic but believable.” He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (1991–1995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: “I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it’s a funny animal, a strange one.” In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.</p><h3>How did SpongeBob died?</h3><table readability=1><tr>Stephen Hillenburg</tr><tr readability=2><td>Institutions</td><td>Orange County Marine Institute</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2>Signature</td></tr></table><h3>Who passed away from SpongeBob?</h3><p><b>Tuck Tucker</b> Dies: ‘SpongeBob SquarePants’ And ‘Hey Arnold! ‘ Animator Was 59.</p><h3>Why did Hillenburg leave SpongeBob?</h3><p>It was announced he was <b>diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)</b> on March 13, 2017.
