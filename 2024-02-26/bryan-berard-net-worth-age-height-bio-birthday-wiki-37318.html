Former defenseman who was the very first choice of 1995’s NHL Draft well-known for his courage in returning in the NHL after losing an eye in a devastating accident during play.</p><p>On the 11th of March in the year 2000&nbsp;On March 11, 2000, <a href=#>Marian Hossa</a>‘s stick clipped Berard’s eye on a follow-through after wildly swinging at the puck.’s stick snuck into Berard’s eye during the follow-through after she wildly swung towards the ball.</p><p>Berard was drafted first overall by the Ottawa Senators in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. As the first overall pick – and with the Senators blue line among the weaker in the league, Berard felt he was going to step right into the National Hockey League. However, after his first training camp with the team, he was reassigned back to Junior hockey and Berard had concerns about the team’s management. Concerned about his development with the club, Berard requested a trade. In January 1996, the Senators traded him in a three-team trade with the New York Islanders and Toronto Maple Leafs that saw his rights, along with those of Wade Redden, Martin Straka, Kirk Muller, Ken Belanger, Don Beaupre and Damian Rhodes move between the three teams.</p><p>Berard joined the Islanders for 1996-97 season and made an impact right away. With 48 points in his rookie season, he led all defensemen on the Islanders in scoring and finished 9th league-wide for blue liners. He was rewarded for his efforts in 1997 by winning the Calder Trophy as the top rookie player in the NHL, edging out Jarome Iginla for the honor. He also played for the United States in the 1998 Winter Olympics. After four years on Long Island, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for goaltender Felix Potvin.</p><p align=justify>When his professional playing time had ended He moved in Lincoln, Rhode Island to spend time with his family.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bryan Berard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Bryan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Berard</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>March 5</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1977</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Woonsocket</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rhode Island</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pisces</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Bryan Berard ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In his second year with the club, he had 30 points in 64 games when tragedy struck. On March 11, 2000, during a game between the Maple Leafs and the Senators in Ottawa, the stick of the Senators’ Marian Hossa clipped Berard in the right eye on a follow through, severely injuring it. The eye was severely slashed on the sclera which resulted in a retinal tear and a detached retina. In the hospital room after the incident, after being told he might lose his eye, Berard reportedly told his friends that he would play hockey again. Despite being optimistic about his future in hockey, he ended up receiving a $6.5 million settlement from his insurance company, what many considered to be a career-ending settlement.</p><h2>Bryan Berard Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Bryan Berard is one of the <strong>richest Hockey Player</strong> from United States.

Berard was the first overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. He is most noted for a debilitating eye injury he received early in his career. Berard underwent several operations, and played 619 games in his NHL career despite the seriousness of the injury.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hockey Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When it became apparent that he might play again, the Maple Leafs stated they were interested in his services, but Berard opted to play for a team that was currently rebuilding and was a bit closer to his home of Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Upon signing a tryout contract with the New York Rangers, he returned his insurance settlement and risked a comeback to the NHL. He played well enough that his tryout contract turned into a $2 million contract for the 2001–02 season, plus two one-year options that could have turned it into a $9.75 million pact. However, he was released by the Rangers after a disappointing season where he only scored 2 goals and 23 points despite playing in all 82 games for the Rangers.</p><p>The Chicago Blackhawks offered him a $2.01 million deal and signed him to a one-year contract. In Chicago, Berard’s game continued to improve and he finished the year second on the team in scoring with 47-points, just one off his career best. He capped his year by being awarded the Bill Masterton Trophy for his dedication to hockey. With his career seemingly on the upswing, the Blackhawks and Berard agreed on a one-year $3 million contract for the 2004-05 campaign. Blackhawks General Manager Bob Pulford was eager to have him back:”His point production was right up there with the best defensemen. He excels on the power play and that’s a huge part of the game now. It was important for us to get him under contract.” But the season was ultimately cancelled due to labour unrest in the league and with a new General Manager replacing Bob Pulford during the cancelled season, Berard was not tendered an offer for the 2005-06 season.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Bryan Berard height</b> Not available right now.
