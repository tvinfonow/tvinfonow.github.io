St. Joseph’s is the same school that Arthur’s childhood hero, Isiah Thomas, attended. Since the school was an hour and a half from his home, Arthur awoke around 5:30 AM daily and took public transportation to reach his destination. Early in his high school career, when his parents were unable to pay the school’s tuition payments, Agee left St. Joseph’s and attended John Marshall High School, an inner-city school. In his senior year, he helped the Marshall Commandos win the 1991 Public League Championship and finish third for the State Championship. Agee’s high school was defeated by Manual High School that was led by future NBA player Howard Nathan.</p><p>Agee is the second child and first son of Arthur “Bo” Agee Sr. and Sheila Agee. During his younger years he lived in the north side Chicago area near where the other star of Hoop Dreams, William Gates, lived. By the time the movie began filming, the Agees had moved to the West Garfield Park neighborhood, which remained Agee’s home until his graduation. Upon graduation from grammar school in 1987, he was discovered by part-time, unofficial talent scout Earl Smith. Smith convinced the Agees to send Arthur to St. Joseph’s High School, a private, predominantly white suburban school.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Arthur Agee</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Austin</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Arnett</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Basketball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>October 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1972</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chicago</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Illinois</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Libra</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sheila Agee, Arthur 'Bo' Agee</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Arthur Agee ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
