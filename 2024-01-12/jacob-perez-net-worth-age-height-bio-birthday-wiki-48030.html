The No. 1 Girl Tour held opening acts from artists Jacob Latimore, Lil Twist, and Kayla Brianna. While on tour, the group visited the Ronald McDonald House in Georgia to cheer up some of the young patients who were battling cancer. In 2013, the group embarked on their All Around The World Tour. Since joining Mindless Behavior, Princeton, along with former bandmates Roc Royal, Ray Ray and Prodigy, have released two albums, performed on tour, and sold over 327,000 album copies in the United States. Later within the year, many news sources announced that there would be a new member after the group’s lead singer, Craig Crippen Jr., who known as Prodigy, had left the group. After lead singer Prodigy left the group, Mindless Behavior did not release any material. As seen in many interviews, there had only been Princeton, Roc Royal, and Ray Ray, which meant that there hadn’t been a lead singer introduced. For almost two years, Mindless Behavior participated in interviews, and even held shows for their fans, without a lead singer. However, many of these shows included nothing but the band performing dance routines, while Prodigy’s voice played in the background. Elijah Johnson replaced him as the lead singer in April 2014.</p><h2>Jacob Perez Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jacob Perez is one of the <strong>richest Singer</strong> from United States.

The pop-up tour was cancelled due to conflicting schedules where Perez would be shooting #WarGames. Fans were refunded in full for their tickets. Perez is set to release his first solo music compilation in 2018, which is being produced by Timeless Music Group.</p><h2>Who is Jacob Perez Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jacob Perez</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.

He would post on his blog, Outsiders Ink, photos or videos of himself in ways that his fans had not seen before. He posted a short film, reciting a poem that he wrote on his blog as well. During an interview in the United Kingdom, Princeton stated that he had not shared his lyrics with fans before, but was always thinking of new lyrics in his mind. He told the interviewer how he was beginning to influence Mindless Behavior’s music more often when in the studio with their producer, Walter Millsap. Not long after, in another interview that featured the group in January 2015, both Princeton and Lopez stated they had been working on projects outside of the group that included music and fashion. “Don’t Believe in Love”, a reggae fusion-pop inspired track, was his first solo record that he released on his SoundCloud account.
