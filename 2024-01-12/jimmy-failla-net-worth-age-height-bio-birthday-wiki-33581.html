He’s also appeared on The Covino and Rich Show and The Lisa Lampanelli Show on Howard 101.</p><p>Failla appears regularly on Kennedy on Fox Business and also makes appearances on Redeye on Fox News as well as Strange Inheritance Unpacked. In addition he has appeared on ESPN’s Dream Job (Season 1, Episode 1), The Today Show (October 8, 2008), BBC America’s Richard Hammond’s Crash Course (October 29, 2012), AXS Television’s Gotham Comedy Live (November 15, 2012), and Season 8 of NBC’s America’s Got Talent (July 2013). Failla’s AGT appearance ended in controversy after he asked to be cut from the program in an open letter to producers, a development that became the lead story on Page Six of the NY Post (July 13, 2013). The fallout had to do with an un-aired portion of Failla’s first round audition in which Judge Mel B deemed one of his jokes “racist” only to have the crowd stage a revolt on his behalf. Despite Mel’s protests, judges Howard Stern, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel voted him on to the Las Vegas round, setting off a wild celebration at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Although that set never aired, it was covered by over 100 news outlets, including TMZ, Perez Hilton, and CBS’s The Talk. The incident also resurfaced on the Howard Stern Show later that summer when comic Lisa Lampanelli criticized Mel B and voiced her support of Failla.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jimmy Failla</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Daron</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Roberts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 17</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1976</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jimmy Failla ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
