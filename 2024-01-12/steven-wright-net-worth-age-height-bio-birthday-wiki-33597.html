It was a pretty weird place.” Lassally booked Wright on NBC’s The Tonight Show, where the comic so impressed host Johnny Carson and the studio audience that less than a week later Wright was invited to appear on the show again. In May 2000, Wright and other Ding Ho alumni including Lenny Clarke, Barry Crimmins, Steve Sweeney, Bill Sohonage and Jimmy Tingle appeared at a reunion benefit for comic Bob Lazarus who was suffering from leukemia.</p><p align=justify>He was born within Burlington, MA with three siblings and Catholic parents.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steven Wright</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Steven</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wright</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Comedian</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cambridge</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Alexander K.

He also supplied the voice of the radio DJ in writer-director Quentin Tarantino’s film Reservoir Dogs that same year. “Dean Parisot’s wife Sally Menke is Quentin Tarantino’s [film] editor, so when she was editing the movie and it was getting down toward the end where they didn’t have the radio DJ yet, she thought of me and told Quentin and he liked the idea,” Wright explained in 2009.</p><p>After his 1990 comedy special Wicker Chairs and Gravity, Wright continued to do stand-up performances, but he was largely absent from television, doing only occasional guest spots on late-night talk shows.

By then Wright had firmly developed a new brand of obscure, laid-back performing and was rapidly building a cult-like following of hip, savvy fans and an onstage persona characterized by an aura of obscurity, with his penchant for non-sequiturs and subdued, slowly-paced delivery style only adding to his mystique. The performance would become one of HBO’s longest running and most requested comedy specials, and would propel him to great success on the college-arena concert circuit.</p><p align=justify>In a 2005 poll to find The Comedian’s Comedian, he was voted amongst the top 50 comedy acts by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.
