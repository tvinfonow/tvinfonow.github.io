Snisky, wrestling as Gene Snitsky, was defeated by fellow WXW wrestler “Smooth” Tommy Suede. It was following this match that he was signed to a developmental deal and sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). Snisky wrestled in OVW as “Mean” Gene Mondo (a name inspired by “Mean” Gene Okerlund), the brother of Mike Mondo.</p><p>He made his WWE debut on the September 13, 2004 edition of Raw against Kane in a no-disqualification match.

Snitsky would use the distraction to hit Kane from behind with the chair, causing Kane to fall on Lita, and causing Lita to miscarry her unborn baby. When interviewed about the incident, Snitsky vehemently claimed that “It Wasn’t My Fault” (which would go on to become the character’s catchphrase).
