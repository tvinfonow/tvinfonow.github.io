After a successful career at Temple University, he was the first round draft pick of Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>He joined the Arizona Cardinals to add depth to the position of linebacker that already had&nbsp;Upon joining the Arizona Cardinals, he added depth to the linebacker position that already included <a href=#>Chandler Jones</a>..</p><p>Reddick joined the Temple University football team as a walk-on in 2012. He was a running back and safety his freshman year. He redshirted for the 2012 season and saw his first game action in 2013. As a senior in 2016, he was named First Team All-AAC after recording 65 tackles and 10.5 sacks as a defensive end.</p><p>On November 14, 2016, it was announced that Reddick had accepted his invitation to play in the 2017 Senior Bowl. He was moved to inside linebacker during the Senior Bowl and impressed team representatives and scouts after excelling in practice. On January 28, 2017, Reddick recorded a game-high nine combined tackles, tying Michigan’s Ben Gedeon, as he played for Chicago Bears’ head coach John Fox’s North team that lost 16-15 to the South. His Senior Bowl performance vastly improved his draft stock and made him one of the fastest risers through the draft process, going from an obscure potential top 100 prospect to a top 20 prospect. He received an invitation to NFL Scouting Combine as a defensive end and completed all the required drills. Reddick’s 11’1″ broad jump was the best among defensive lineman since 2003 and his 4.52 in the 40-yard dash was the best among the defensive lineman at the draft and second best among linebackers. He also attended Temple’s Pro Day and decided to only run the shuttle, three-cone, and do positional drills. Reddick was projected to be a first round pick by NFL draft experts and analysts. He was ranked the best linebacker prospect in the draft by ESPN, the second best linebacker by Sports Illustrated, ranked the best outside linebacker by NFLDraftScout.com, and the second best linebacker by NFL media analyst Mike Mayock.</p><p align=justify>Raymond Matthew and Raelakia Reddick are his parents.&nbsp;His father was a wide receiver at Clarion.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Haason Reddick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Haason</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Reddick</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>September 22</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1994</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Camden</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Raelakia Reddick, Raymond Matthew</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Haason Reddick ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
