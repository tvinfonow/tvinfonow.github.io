Commenting on the album’s concept, Henry stated: “NOVA’ came from obsessive ideation on growth and on transition. The art and stories and the moments that inspired me through this record tend to explore this as well. The feeling of leaving behind what was, and of welcoming the foreign. Throughout the process, I had this vision of a ‘nova’ or of a star no bigger than a person launching from earth into outer space and expanding endlessly until its light was all that we could see. That’s the feeling I get from these records, infinite light.” The album’s last single, “Light Me Up”, which featured the vocals of Miguel and Julia Michaels, was released on July 25, 2018. Initially an unused Jack Ü demo which was shown to Grime by Diplo, Grime decided to build the demo out and have Miguel’s and Michaels’ vocals recut, since he felt that the album required a “summery vibe” to it.</p><h2>Who is Rl Grime Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Rl Grime</strong> is possibily <strong>single</strong> & has not been previously engaged.
