After more deep dive practices, on October 12 she prepared to attempt a dive to 171 metres. On reaching 171 metres she opened the valve on the air tank to inflate the lift bag which would raise her rapidly to the surface but the cylinder had no air in it. A rescue diver arrived and inflated the lift bag with his air supply but the bag did not rise fast enough due to insufficient inflation, the riser rope being non-vertical and strong currents. A dive that should have been no more than three minutes resulted in her remaining underwater for more than eight and a half minutes. By the time her husband put on scuba gear and dove down to pick up her unconscious body to the surface it was too late and she was pronounced dead at a hospital on shore. The dive was controversial and heavily criticised as the setup did not match common freediving safety standards. Much of the diving community critique targeted her husband Ferreras who had hurried an underfunded organisation for this record attempt, previously planned for a later date, notably with too few safety divers, lacking proper rescue equipment, with no doctors at sea and shore. Ferreras was in charge of Mestre’s lift bag air tank and did not allow any of the team to check that the tank had been charged. Mestre was not recovered to the surface until nine minutes into her dive, she had a pulse at the surface, but there were no medical doctors available to treat her and minutes were wasted with Ferreras attempting to resuscitate her in the water. An ESPN documentary film written and directed by Alison Ellwood in 2013 had live video footage of the incident and interviews with crew members and staff.</p><h2>Who is Audrey Mestre Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Audrey Mestre</strong> married to <strong>Francisco Ferreras </strong>.
