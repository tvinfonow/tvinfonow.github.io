He was also convicted for rape and sexual violence. Franklin earned his nickname when he appeared to have taken a 14-year break from his crimes, from 1988 to 2002.</p><p>The known killings began in 1985 in South Los Angeles. The “Grim Sleeper” apparently took a 14-year hiatus after his last known crime in 1988 and the murders then resumed in 2002 (leading to the epithet by which he is known), but this history may be only an accident of the evidence collected. The last confirmed slaying was in January 2007. All of his victims were found outdoors, often in alleys a short distance from downtown Los Angeles.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Grim Sleeper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hakan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Turan</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Killer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 30</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1952</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sylvia Franklin</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Christopher Franklin</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Grim Sleeper ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He served time for one of the theft charges.</p><p>Law enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was not previously collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised probation. In 2004, voters passed Proposition 69, which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin’s DNA was supposed to be entered in the system but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Grim Sleeper height</b> Not available right now.

Margaret Prescod formed the “Black Women Count” movement with community members to pressure the LAPD into acknowledging the deaths as serial killings and forming a task force in response. The coalition launched a media campaign and set a monetary reward aiming to capture the killer. The joint LAPD-Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department investigation determined that the crimes were committed by a single person labeled the “Southside Slayer”. Their results were announced to the public on September 23, 1985.</p><p align=justify>Police had found no exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes and any of the profiles in California’s DNA profile database, so they searched the database for stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to allow police to infer a familial relationship. They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin’s son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a felony weapons charge in 2008. Christopher was too young to have committed the murders, but the familial DNA match led investigators to look at his father, Lonnie, as the likely perpetrator. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin’s DNA to make the link.</p><h2>Who is Grim Sleeper Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Grim Sleeper</strong> married to <strong>Sylvia Franklin</strong>.

That same year, in secrecy, the LAPD formed the “800 Task Force,” composed of six detectives and overseen by the Robbery-Homicide Unit. After a four-month investigation, LA Weekly investigative reporter Christine Pelisek broke the news of the task force’s existence, the link between Peters’ killing and the earlier murders, and the silence of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief William J. Bratton regarding the killer’s existence. Villaraigosa and Bratton neither issued a press release nor warned the community.
