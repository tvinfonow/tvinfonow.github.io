People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time. Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked. Some may have difficulty throwing things out. These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.</description></item><item><title>Karl-Otto Alberty</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/vkyewd2-21155.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/vkyewd2-21155.html</guid><description>Karl-Otto Alberty was a German actor known for playing S.S.
