Despite my love for RDJ, Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams, they could not save the very dull Sherlock Holmes movies. However, that being said, I still was very fond of Holmes as a character. RDJ did him very well. He seems to have a talent for the quirky, dry-humored characters. Sherlock definitely has a lot of inner demons, and uses his humor to hide that.</description></item><item><title>Julia Rabello pictures and photos</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/7yjri4r-21375.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/7yjri4r-21375.html</guid><description>Post an imagencG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunC21KWgmmWilq%2BmuMuoZqmhk6nCs7HS</description></item><item><title>Kathleen &amp;quot;Kat&amp;quot; Harvey</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/5o3lj0y-21393.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/5o3lj0y-21393.html</guid><description>Kathleen "Kat" Harvey was born to Dr James Harvey and Amelia Harvey in 1980, and is the tritagonist in the 1995 Casper feature flim.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka
The quokka (Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size of a domestic cat.
Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as the kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. It can be found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, in particular on Rottnest Island just off Perth and Bald Island near Albany.</description></item><item><title>Felix Mallard pictures and photos</title><link>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/edl1ivr-21262.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/edl1ivr-21262.html</guid><description>Post an image Sort by: Recent - Votes - Views « Prev12 Next » ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCyxKWgsWWdlrmtrdGdZqmhk6nCs7HS</description></item><item><title>Fictional Characters > Robert+mccollum Fictional Characters</title><link>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/631lquf-21265.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/explore-a-wealth-of-information-on-various-topics/631lquf-21265.html</guid><description>Fictional Characters tagged as 'Robert+mccollum' by the Listal community

The Nerd really adds some depth to his coverage of video game history, along with the trademark humor. The first disc is fantastically funny and the Odyssey system review is particularly impressive, since the "console" is from 1972. My favourite is the Terminator games retrospective. Two great movies, tons of shitty video games and one awesome strategy to get extra lives that didn't quite work.</description></item><item><title>Duane Whitaker</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/30hlsz3-20492.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/30hlsz3-20492.html</guid><description>Description: Duane Whitaker, a native of Lubbock Texas, has spent the last 30 years as one of Hollywood's most entertaining hyphenates.

Sadly, lots of great titles have slipped away from our collective gaming memory, especially pre-rendered games like Alice.</description></item><item><title>Anveshi Jain</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/9yu5md4-19749.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/9yu5md4-19749.html</guid><description>Anveshi Jain is an Indian Actress, Model, Show Host, Human Behaviour Analyst, Electrical Engineer and Travel Blogger.

The Great Dane is a German breed of domestic dog known for its giant size. It is a short-haired breed with a strong, galloping figure.
The Great Dane combines, in its regal appearance, dignity, strength and elegance with great size and a powerful, well-formed, smoothly muscled body. It is one of the giant working breeds but is unique in that its general conformation must be so well balanced that it never appears clumsy and shall move with a long reach and powerful drive.</description></item><item><title>George Houvardas</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/bb1s3ch-19123.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/bb1s3ch-19123.html</guid><description>My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunCzxKipoJ1dnby2wsCrm5qr</description></item><item><title>Hannah van der Westhuysen pictures and photos</title><link>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/khg54zm-19132.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dive-into-the-latest-celebrity-gossip-and-news/khg54zm-19132.html</guid><description>Post an image Sort by: Recent - Votes - Views ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunC0wKelmqBdq66vecOeqWavlajBqcHYrJynZ6CesLXB0Z6q</description></item><item><title>Jen Richards</title><link>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/cxnvff7-19133.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stay-updated-with-the-latest-news-and-trends/cxnvff7-19133.html</guid><description>Tags: Actress (2), Transgender (2), Lgbt (1), Tattoos (1), Trans (1), Transgender Woman (1) My tags: Add tagsncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXSrZilZpOkunC2xKdkq6GTna6zsNKYoK8%3D</description></item><item><title>Jennifer Hardwick</title><link>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/34teual-19073.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/get-timely-updates-on-current-events/34teual-19073.html</guid><description>Tags: BGC Season 10 (1), Basic Bitch (1), No Edges (1), Long Chin (1), Wannabe Celebrity (1), Has No Respect For Herself (1), BGCASB 1 Winner (1), Can't Fight For Shit!
