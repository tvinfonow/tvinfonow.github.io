He said of the experience, “All I saw and all I felt at first was complete darkness. I’ve never been in a space that was blacker, and I remember feeling that whatever it was I was doing, it was really wrong. Then the next thing I remember was seeing myself on the floor, on the steps outside my hotel bathroom, and there was a lot of activity going on around me. I tried to shout out “I’m up here!” from wherever it was I was floating but nobody could hear me. In some ways it was very liberating. Then I came to and a cop was handcuffing me. It certainly wasn’t a place I’d like to visit again.” Several months later, after facing drug charges, Gahan sought help at a rehabilitation center.</p><h2>Dave Gahan Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Dave Gahan is one of the <strong>richest Rock Singer</strong> from United Kingdom.
