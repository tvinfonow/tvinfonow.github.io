U.S. with “Obsession” in 2010.</p><p align=justify>Julianne Escobedo Shepberd from Rolling Stone wrote that Ferreira’s “songs are catchy, but they’re also thickly glazed with fuzz and synths, evoking influences like Suicide, Siouxsie Sioux and the krautrock group Harmonia”. Karolina Ramos from The GW Hatchet compared Ferreira to New Zealand recording artist Lorde, both of whom she felt “tackle contemporary love, desire and insecurity with depth, composure and frankness.” She compared her musical style to 1980s pop music, and noted that “her throaty, sultry vocals call to mind Lana del Rey, abandoning brightness and vivacity for a colder tone. Still, Ferreira can drop the edge, with gentler tracks like “Sad Dream” showcasing her vocal range and seldom-observed softness.” Andrew Unterberger stated that “through a variety of singles, EPs, guest features and live appearances, Sky has proven herself one of the most talented singers, creative songwriters and savvy collaborators currently working in the genre”, but blamed “bad marketing, label disputes and her own perfectionism” for the extended delay of Night Time, My Time; he also stated that the repeated renaming of the record itself “should give you some idea of the musical identity issues she’s suffered over the years.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pop Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After releasing the tracks “17” and “One”, the latter having peaked at number 64 on the UK Singles Chart, Ferreira announced that her debut studio album would be released on January 11, 2011. Its lead single “Obsession” peaked at number 37 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. These plans never came to fruition, and were substituted for the extended play (EP) As If! and its lead single “Sex Rules” that March. A writer for MuuMuse spoke favorably of her “vocal and musical versatility” and commended the project as a “rock solid 5-track collection of next-level crunchy pop cuts.” During this time, Ferreira was featured in the advertising campaign for the Calvin Klein “CK One” product line alongside Cassie Ventura. The following year, she was photographed by Ellen von Unwerth for the cover of Vs., and appeared in the Adidas “Originals” commercial with rappers Big Sean and Snoop Dogg.</p><p>After establishing a friendship with singer Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue “following her every move”. Ferreira commented that “[Miley’s] obviously way bigger and all eyes [are] on her, but I feel like we’re kind of going through a similar thing where everyone’s trying to say that we’re trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It’s nice to have someone that gets it.” Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded “there’s nothing about that photo that’s pornographic; we came on this earth nude.” Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said “I feel like I’m doing a bad job of being a feminist if I’m not making someone angry.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Sky Ferreira height</b> <strong>5 ft 6 in</strong> Sky <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ferreira began maintaining a Myspace profile where she uploaded demo versions of self-written tracks.
