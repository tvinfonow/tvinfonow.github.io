According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Doug Howard</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Howard was signed to his first recording contract with Atco Records by then label president Doug Morris, with the AOR/Metal band Touch in 1979. The debut self-titled release of the band produced two significant singles, “Call Me When The Spirit Moves You” and “Don’t You Know What Love Is.” One of the band’s most notable performances was at the first Castle Donington Monsters of Rock Festival in Nottingham, England, where Howard accidentally swallowed a bee immediately after the band’s performance opening for The Scorpions, Judas Priest and Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow. Touch recorded their second album with Todd Rundgren as producer.</p><p align=justify>In 1989, Howard was invited to join an album project titled Stun Leer as its lead vocalist which was being produced in Boston by Bob St. John and Anthony Resta. The album, despite various overtures from the US labels, was never picked up in the States and stayed on the shelf. A few years later, by virtue of a few leaks of the material, the album had become a file-sharing sensation in the UK, Europe, and Japan on the burgeoning Napster file sharing network. MTM Records of Germany tracked the band down and signed the project, but Stun Leer only performed a few shows in support of the release, as by that time the members had all moved onto other projects.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Singer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Doug Howard height</b> Not available right now.
