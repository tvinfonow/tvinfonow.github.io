Stephanie Yim Bell, a Korean-American professional wrestler was born April 16, 1989. She is currently signed to WWE and performs on the NXT brand as Mia Yim.&nbsp;Bell appeared in WWE’s Mae Young Classic 2017 and 2018. She has also worked in national promotions like Ring of Honor (ROH) and independent promotions like Combat Zone Wrestling, CZW, Shimmer Women Athletes and Shine Wrestling.&nbsp;She has held the Shine Tag Team Championship as well as the Shine Championship in Shine with Leva Bates.&nbsp;She has also wrestled in Japan for Reina Joshuai Puroresu.&nbsp;Bell was also a member of Impact Wrestling, where she was a former Champion at Impact Knockouts.&nbsp;She was named one of BBC’s 100 Women in 2016.</p><p>Yim was invited to wrestle in Japan in 2011 by Universal Woman’s Pro Wrestling Reina after she graduated from college.&nbsp;Reina’s connection with Consejo Mundial De Lucha Libre allowed Yim to learn Mexican lucha libre.</p><p>Thanks to her performance at the Mae Young Classic, on September 24, it was confirmed that Yim was signed to a contract with WWE and would begin working at NXT. Just a month later, on the October 24 episode of NXT, Yim made her in–debut as part of the brand, defeating Aliyah. In November, after a backstage altercation between the two, Yim faced Bianca Belair who would hand her first loss and that would also spark a feud between the two. Yim was able to bounce off the loss and defeat Reina Gonzalez to earn herself a spot for an upcoming fatal–four-way match to determine the number one contender for the NXT Women’s Championship, however, the match was won by Belair. Shortly after Belair’s undefeated streak was ended, Yim was able to defeat her in two different matches to end their feud.</p><p>On the December 2 episode of Impact Wrestling, Jade lost to Rosemary in a “Six Sides of Steel” cage match for the vacated TNA Knockouts Championship. In mid–January 2017, the feud between Rosemary and Jade re–emerged and this led to a Monster’s ball match, where Rosemary defeated Jade to retain her championship. Jade received a rematch against Rosemary on the March 2 episode of Impact Wrestling, in a Last Knockout Standing match, which she lost. This was Jade’s last match in TNA, and it was officially announced earlier in the week that she was not signed to a new contract and confirming her departure from the company.</p><p align=justify>Yim started working at Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), as a manager for Adam Cole, after training with DJ Hyde at their Combat Zone Wrestling training school.&nbsp;In December 2010, Cole and Yim made their debut at Cage of Death II. They were presented as a storyline couple. Yim often interfered in Cole’s matches in order to win.&nbsp;Excellent started feuding with Cole after he beat Greg Excellent in Down With The Sickness 2011.&nbsp;In November, Excellent faced Yim in an intergender match at Night Of Infamy 10 : Ultimatum.&nbsp;Yim defeated Excellent in a rematch in January 2012. To end the feud, Yim challenged Excellent for a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs Match at Aerial Assault 2012. Yim won.&nbsp;Before leaving CZW, she made just two more appearances that year.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mia Yim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Mia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Yim</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Professional Wrestler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1989</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Mia Yim ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
