He was deemed “not athletic enough to be a consistent pass blocker against the faster pass rushers” at left tackle however, and therefore was projected to “have a long, solid career on the right side”. Initially thought of as a potential first-rounder, Britton fell to the second round, where he was selected 39th overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Reportedly angry about not being drafted in the first round, Britton said: “I’m gonna work my ass off for the Jacksonville Jaguars and people are gonna regret it.
