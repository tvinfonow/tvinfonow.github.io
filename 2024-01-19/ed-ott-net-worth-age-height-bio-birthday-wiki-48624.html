Who is Ed Ott dating now & how much money does Ed Ott have?</p><h2>Ed Ott Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Ed Ott</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Baseball Player</strong> who was born on <strong>July 11, 1951</strong> in Muncy, Muncy, <strong>United States</strong>. Nathan Edward Ott (born July 11, 1951), is an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher from 1974 to 1981, most notably as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates team with whom he won a World Series championship in 1979. He also played for the California Angels. Ott was a left-handed batter and threw right-handed.</p><p>Known as a tough, no-nonsense player, Ott was a former wrestler who was not afraid to use those skills on a baseball diamond. In an August 12, 1977, game against the New York Mets, Ott slid hard into Mets’ second baseman Felix Millán trying to break up a double play. Millán shouted at Ott and hit him with a baseball in his hand. Ott answered this by picking Milan up, upending him, and then slamming him into his extended knee at Three Rivers Stadium, severely injuring his shoulder. The incident effectively ended Milan’s MLB career.</p><p>Ott platooned with catcher Steve Nicosia in 1979, and had his best season with a .273 batting average along with 7 home runs, 51 runs batted in and a career-high .994 fielding percentage, second only to Gene Tenace among National League catchers. Led by future Hall of Fame inductee, Willie Stargell, the 1979 Pirates won the National League Eastern Division pennant, then defeated the Cincinnati Reds in the 1979 National League Championship Series, before winning the 1979 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. During the seven-game series, Ott posted a .333 batting average along with 3 runs batted in.</p><p>With young catcher Tony Peña ready to take over the catching duties, the Pirates traded Ott to the California Angels in April 1981. Ott had a down year in 1981 batting just .217. Ott tore his rotator cuff and underwent surgery, causing him to miss the entire 1982 season. He appeared briefly as a first baseman in the Angels minor-league organization in 1983 and 1984 before retiring as a player at the age of 32.</p><p align=justify>Ott made the Pirates major league roster as third-string catcher in 1976, backing up Manny Sanguillén and Duffy Dyer. The Pirates traded Sanguillen to the Oakland Athletics before the 1977 season, and new Pirates manager Chuck Tanner installed Ott into a platoon role alongside Dyer. He played in 104 games that year while hitting for a .264 batting average.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed Ott</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ed</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 11</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1951</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Muncy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Muncy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Ed Ott ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
