She took a job as a media coordinator at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, New Hampshire.</p><p>On August 1, 1990, Detective Daniel Pelletier approached Smart in her school’s parking lot. Smart recognized him, having spoken to him on at least six other occasions. Taken by surprise, she asked, “What’s up?” “Well, Pam,” Pelletier said in the recording, “I have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news is that we’ve solved the murder of your husband. The bad news is you’re under arrest.” “What for?” Smart asked. “First-degree murder.” Smart was then handcuffed and arraigned at the Derry District Court and jailed at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women which was in Goffstown at the time.</p><p align=justify>There was an elder sister who was named Elizabeth and an younger brother called John.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pamela Smart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pamela</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Smart</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>August 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Coral Gables</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Florida</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Leo</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Linda Wojas, John Wojas</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Greggory Smart</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Pamela Smart ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Police officials said the crime scene looked like a disrupted burglary. Smart was later accused of seducing 15-year-old Flynn and threatening to stop having sex with him unless he killed her husband. Flynn did so with the help of friends Patrick “Pete” Randall, Vance “J.R.” Lattime, Jr., and Raymond Fowler.</p><h2>Pamela Smart Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Pamela Smart is one of the <strong>richest Criminal</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Pamela Smart</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>She was a lover of the heavy metal genre as well as hosted her own show on radio known as Metal Madness.</p><p align=justify>She was helped in killing the husband of her 15-year-old love interest William Flynn and three of the boy’s closest friends.</p><p align=justify>Pamela Ann Smart (née Wojas) (born August 16, 1967) is an American woman who was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, witness tampering and accomplice to first degree murder. In 1990 at age 22, Smart was accused of conspiring with her underaged sex partner, then 15-year-old William “Billy” Flynn, and three of his friends to have her 24-year-old husband Greggory Smart killed in Derry, New Hampshire. She was later convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and witness tampering. She is currently serving a life sentence at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, a maximum security prison in Westchester County, New York.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Criminal</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After a 14-day trial that culminated on March 22, 1991 in the Rockingham County Superior Court, Smart was found guilty of “being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and witness tampering. The tampering stemmed from Pamela’s coercing Cecilia to not say anything to authorities or to lie. The conviction was largely the result of the testimony of her co-conspirators and secretly taped conversations in which Smart appeared to contradict her claims of having wanted to reconcile with her husband and of having no knowledge of the boys’ plot. She could have been charged with capital murder, but the prosecution decided against it. Later that day, she was given a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole.</p><p>When oral arguments began March 4, 1991, Assistant Attorney General Diane Nicolosi portrayed the teenagers as naïve victims of an “evil woman bent on murder.” The prosecution portrayed Pamela Smart as the cold-blooded mastermind who controlled her underaged sex partner. Nicolosi claimed that Smart seduced Flynn to get him to murder her husband, so that she could avoid an expensive divorce and benefit from a $140,000 life insurance policy. In her testimony, Smart acknowledged that she had what she termed an “affair” with the underaged boy, but claimed that the murder of her husband was solely the doing of Flynn and his friends as a reaction to her telling Flynn that she wished to end their “relationship” and repair her marriage. She insisted that she neither participated in the murder plot nor had any foreknowledge of it. Though Flynn claimed he had fallen in love with Smart when he first met her, Cecilia Pierce testified at trial that Smart and Flynn were originally just friends. Pierce first noticed a change about February, when Smart confessed to her that she “loved Bill.” Flynn testified at trial that he was a virgin before he had sex with Pamela Smart.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Pamela Smart height</b> Not available right now.

On May 14, 1990, an anonymous tip also indicated that a teenager named Cecilia Pierce was aware of the plan. Police talked to Cecilia, who then agreed to wear a wire and record conversations with Smart in hopes that she would say something incriminating, which she did.</p><p align=justify>In October 1996, Smart was severely beaten by fellow inmates Mona Graves and Ghania Miller. This resulted in the insertion of a plastic plate in the left side of her face. The two inmates beat Smart after they accused her of snitching on them about their prison relationship. Graves and Miller were convicted of second-degree assault in the attack on Smart at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility and were subsequently transferred to separate prisons. As a result of the beating, she takes medication for chronic pain and sometimes thinks of suicide. Her counselor, Dr. Eleanor Pam, says that “she has many, many, many dark days.”</p><h2>Who is Pamela Smart Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Pamela Smart</strong> married to <strong>Greggory Smart </strong>.
