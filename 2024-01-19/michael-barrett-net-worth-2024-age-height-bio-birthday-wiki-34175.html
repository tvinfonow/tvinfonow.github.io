On August 22, 2004, Oswalt beaned Barrett. Barrett, believing the pitch was a reaction to a three-run home run that Aramis Ramírez had previously hit, confronted Oswalt, and prompted both teams to take the field. Oswalt was ejected from the game, as the Astros went on to lose 11-6. Five days later, during another Cubs-Astros game, Barrett mouthed off to Oswalt and attempted to confront him. The game’s umpires restrained the two before a fight could break out, but not before both benches cleared out. Oswalt remained in the game, and defeated the Cubs 15-7.
