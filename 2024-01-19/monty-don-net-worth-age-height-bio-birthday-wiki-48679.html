He is a television host best known for his work with the BBC’s Gardeners’ World.&nbsp;He was also a columnist for The Observer and hosted Channel 4’s Lost Gardens and Real Gardens.</p><p>He took over&nbsp;He replaced <a href=#>Alan Titchmarsh</a> as the host of Gardeners’ World.’s role as host of Gardeners World.</p><p>Montagu Denis Wyatt “Monty” Don OBE (born George Montagu Don; 8 July 1955) is a British television presenter, writer and speaker on horticulture, best known for presenting the BBC television series Gardeners’ World.</p><p>In 1981, Don and Erskine started Monty Don Jewellery, a business that designed, made, and sold costume jewellery. In 1986, they operated from a shop on Beauchamp Place in Knightsbridge, London and the company grew to have 20 employees, hundreds of outworkers, and 60 outlets across the US, including Harrods, Harvey Nichols, and Liberty, and sold their products to Boy George, Michael Jackson, and Princess Diana. However, the 1987 stock market crash caused an almost complete bankruptcy as it cut off American sales, their biggest market. The situation prompted Don to embark on a career in writing and broadcasting. Reflecting on the experience, he wrote: “We were lambs to the slaughter and we lost everything, […] we lost our house, our business. We sold every stick of furniture we had at Leominster market”. He was unemployed from 1991 to 1993, and spent all of 1992 on the dole. Some of the jewellery is kept at the V&A Museum in London.</p><p align=justify>His parents were English and he was born in Germany.&nbsp;He married Sarah Don and had three children.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=2><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Monty Don</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Monty</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Don</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Tv Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>July 8</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Iserlohn</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>North Rhine-Westphalia</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cancer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Sarah Don</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Freya Don, Tom Don, Adam Don</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Monty Don ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He featured as a guest presenter for the BBC’s Holiday programme. From 1994 to 1995 he appeared from time to time as one of the presenters for the weekly science programme Tomorrow’s World on BBC One. He went on to present several Channel 4 land and gardening series: Don Roaming, Fork to Fork, Real Gardens and Lost Gardens, and wrote a regular weekly gardening column for The Observer between February 1994 and May 2006 and for the Daily Mail and Mail Online since 2004.</p><h2>Monty Don Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Monty Don is one of the <strong>richest Tv Show Host</strong> from Germany. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Monty Don</b>'s net worth <strong>$5 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>Before being accepted to Magdalene College in Cambridge, he attended Quidhampton School.</p><p align=justify>He and his wife founded Monty Don Jewellery, a company that makes costume jewelry.</p><p align=justify>Don was born George Montagu Don on 8 July 1955 in Iserlohn, West Germany, the youngest son of British parents Denis Thomas Keiller Don, a career soldier posted in Germany, and Janet Montagu (née Wyatt). A family dispute over his name caused his parents to remove “George” from his name and his birth certificate changed to Montagu Denis Don. At age 10 Don added his mother’s maiden name of Wyatt to it. Both of his paternal grandparents were Scottish, through whom he is descended from botanist George Don and the Keiller family of Dundee, inventors of a brand of marmalade in 1797. On his maternal side, he is descended from the Wyatt family, who were a prominent dynasty of architects. When Don was one, the family moved to Hertfordshire, England. He had a twin sister and three other siblings; his twin suffered a broken neck and blindness after a car crash at the age of 19. Don describes his parents as being “very strict”.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>TV Show Host</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Don was the main presenter on BBC Two’s Gardeners’ World from 2003 to 2008 succeeding Alan Titchmarsh. He was the first self-taught horticulturist presenter in the show’s 36-year history, stepping down only after suffering a minor stroke. After viewing figures for Gardeners’ World fell below two million for the first time in 2009, in January 2010, changes were announced to the programme in an attempt to entice viewers back. In December 2010, it was announced that Don would be returning to the programme as lead presenter for the 2011 series, replacing Toby Buckland. Reaction to the announcement was divided on the programme’s blog. Since March 2011 he has been presenting the programme from his own garden, Longmeadow, in Herefordshire. He was frequently seen on screen with his golden retriever Nigel until the dog died in May 2020, shortly before his 12th birthday. In 2016 Don had also introduced viewers of Gardeners’ World to a new golden retriever called Nellie and in April 2020 introduced a Yorkshire terrier called Pattie.</p><p>He is a keen proponent of organic gardening and the practice of organic techniques often features in his published and broadcast work. The organic approach is most prominent in his 2003 book The Complete Gardener. This has led him into some controversy with those advocating non-organic techniques, with some criticising his position of influence presenting Gardeners’ World and exclusion of non-organic solutions to pests and diseases in the garden.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Monty Don height</b> Not available right now.

The couple lived in Islington, north London, while Don pursued postgraduate study at London School of Economics and worked as a waiter at Joe Allen restaurant in Covent Garden and later as a binman. He completed two unpublished novels, The Clematis Affair and An Afternoon in Padua, which he later described as “excruciatingly bad”. The couple then moved to the De Beauvoir Town area of Hackney where they made their first garden. In 1989, they relocated to The Hanburies, a large country house in Herefordshire. The making of the gardens there and the subsequent loss of the house in the aftermath of the crash of their business was the subject of his first published book, The Prickotty Bush. Since 1991, the family have lived at Ivington, Herefordshire.</p><p align=justify>In July 2006 he appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, choosing an eclectic mix of pop and classical records; the Beatles’ “A Hard Day’s Night” was his favourite disc, his book choice was Collected Poems by Henry Vaughan and his luxury item the painting Hendrikje Bathing by Rembrandt.</p><h2>Who is Monty Don Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Monty Don</strong> married to <strong>Sarah Don </strong>.
