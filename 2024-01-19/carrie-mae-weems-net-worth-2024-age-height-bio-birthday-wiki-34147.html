Who is Carrie Mae Weems dating now & how much money does Carrie Mae Weems have?</p><h2>Carrie Mae Weems Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Carrie Mae Weems</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Photographer</strong> who was born on <strong>April 20, 1953</strong> in Portland, Oregon, <strong>United States</strong>. Weems was the second child of seven to Carrie Polk, Myrlie Weems, and was born in Portland in 1953.&nbsp;In 1965, she began performing in street theater and dance.&nbsp;Faith C. Weems was her first child and her only child at the age of 16.&nbsp;She moved out of her parents’ house in the following year and quickly relocated to San Francisco, where she studied modern dance with Anna Halprin. Halprin started the workshop with many other dancers and artists John Cage as well as Robert Morris.&nbsp;At the age of 28, she decided to continue arts education and attended the California Institute of the Arts Valencia. She graduated with her B.A.&nbsp;She earned her MFA at the University of California in San Diego.&nbsp;Weems was also a graduate student in folklore at the University of California.</p><p>Weems also created the Africa Series (1993-1992), the Sea Island Series (1991-92), From Here, I Saw What Happened, and I Cried (1995-96), Who What When Where (1998), Ritual & Revolution (191998), Ritual & Revolution (1998), The Louisiana Project (2003), Roaming (2006) and the Museum Series which she started in 2007.&nbsp;Grace Notes: Reflections for Now is her most recent multimedia performance. It explores the role of grace in the pursuit for democracy.</p><p>Weems’ work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Portland Art Museum, the Tate Museum in London and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Weems has been represented by Jack Shainman Gallery since 2008.</p><p>A full-color, visual book, titled Carrie Mae Weems, was published by Yale University Press in October 2012. The book offers the first major survey of Weems’ career and includes a collection of essays from leading and emerging scholars in addition to over 200 of Weems’ most important works.</p><p align=justify>Carrie Mae Weems’ first collection of photos, text and spoken words, Family Pictures and Stories, was completed in 1983.&nbsp;These images were about her family and told her story. She said she was trying out to understand the migration of black families from the South into the North through the use of her family as a model.&nbsp;In 1988, she completed her next series called Ain’t Jokin’.&nbsp;It was a series that focused on internalized racism and racial jokes.&nbsp;American Icons was another series that focused on racism. It was completed in 1989.&nbsp;Weems stated that she had been moving away from documentary photography in the 1980s. Instead, she created “representations that looked like documents, but were actually staged”, and “incorporated text, using multiples photos and creating narratives.”&nbsp;Her next focus was on sexuality.&nbsp;This was the subject of The Kitchen Table series, which she completed in just over two years (1989-1990). Weems was the main character in the photographs.&nbsp;Weems said about Family Pictures and Stories and Kitchen Table: “I use the constructed image I created as a vehicle to question ideas about the role and nature of tradition, the nature and relationships of men and women, women and their children, and among women. This helps me understand the important issues and possible solutions.”&nbsp;She expressed concern at the lack of images of black people, especially black women, in popular media. Through her art, she hopes to show these subjects and share their experiences.&nbsp;These photos created space for black female artists to create new art.&nbsp;Weems also spoke out about the inspirations and themes in her entire work.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carrie Mae Weems</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Carrie</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Weems</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Photographer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 20</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1953</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Portland</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Oregon</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Carrie Weems, Myrlie Weems</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Jeffrey Hoone</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Faith C.
