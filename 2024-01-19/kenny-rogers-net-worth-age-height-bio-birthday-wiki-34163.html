Larry Rodriguez of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex’ Fox Network affiliate KDFW was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, arm and leg pain.

While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit. The suspension was subsequently upheld by Selig. The commissioner was later overruled by independent arbitor Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to play after sitting out 13 games.
