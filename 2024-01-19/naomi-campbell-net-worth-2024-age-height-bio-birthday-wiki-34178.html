Produced by Youth and Tim Simenon, the album was only commercially successful in Japan; it failed to reach the top 75 on the UK charts, while its only single, “Love and Tears”, reached No. 40. Baby Woman was mocked by critics, inspiring the Naomi Awards for terrible pop music.

By then, Campbell, Turlington, Evangelista, Crawford and Claudia Schiffer formed an elite group of models declared “supermodels” by the fashion industry. With the addition of newcomer Kate Moss, they were collectively known as the “Big Six”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Naomi Campbell height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Naomi <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Campbell was born in Streatham, South London to Jamaican-born dancer Valerie Morris.
